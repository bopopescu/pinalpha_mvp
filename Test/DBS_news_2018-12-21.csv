"The 2018 Aston Martin DBS Superleggera is a beautiful GT coupe, but it just has one problem.",-1,0
"It puts down 715 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque from its 5.2-liter V12, and it makes it almost impossible to keep it in a straight line.",-1,0
"Harry Metcalfe makes a good point in the latest episode of Harrys Garage.",-1,0
"While the Superleggera is not exactly meant to be the sort of car you measure by the tenths of a second, the sheer amount of power it puts down left him almost wishing it split up that power to all four wheels:
As Harry reports, the engine produces so much torque for the car it has to have a different ZF 8-speed automatic transmission, which doesnt begin to apply the full amount of power until you get through first and second gear.",-1,0
"In sport mode, on winter tires and in cold temperatures, after a bit of driving, the traction control system still kicks in to try to manage the car when you put the power down.",-1,0
"It keeps you on your toes, to say the least... Im getting to know the traction control light way too much.",-1,0
"Harry says the torque become too much for the tires to handle even at just half-throttle, at least in the December conditions hes driving in.",-1,0
"But he also says hed buy this car for regular driving, which means he expects it to be able to cope with colder conditions.",-1,0
"As much as I want to love to a car that has too much power for its own good, a car that you constantly have to manage the moment you try to get sporty with it, Harrys video sort of suggests theres just too much going on and the car cant quite manage everything.",-1,0
"That, coupled with an interior layout and quality he says is lacking compared to the Bentley Continental he drove a few weeks back, and overly sensitive brakes, bring the car a few pegs down despite how much he enjoyed the DB11 when he last drove it.",-1,0
"But he still like it and wants to revisit when it isnt as compromised by the cold.",-1,0

"I personally recommend the DBS Woman's World Mastercard (WMC) and DBS Altitude Card combo if you typically charge a lot of online travel expenses to your card - I personally max out the S$2,000 bonus each month on the WMC and charge the remaining online hotel and travel expenses to my DBS Altitude Card (up to S$5,000) for the rest of the statement period.",-1,0
"Now, DBS advertises 3 miles per dollar on the DBS Altitude Card and if it is charged in SGD, you will earn 1,2 miles (in equivalent DBS Points) at the time of posting and the rest in the following month (usually on the 16th unless it is not a business day).",-1,0

Without hesitation, the best car I drove this year was the Porsche 911 GT2 RS.",-1,0
"Not merely for the ludicrous performance results it achieved (production car lap records at Big Willow and Laguna Seca, set a new lap record on our figure-eight test, ties the record for our shortest stop from 60 mph, ran the quickest 0-60 time this year) but because it does all of these things so effortlessly and with such confidence.",-1,0

"Well talk about that in a little bit.",-1,0
"Did pick up the three guys on Signing Day, the three Lakeland guys, but as you and I have talked about off the air and stuff, you had 17 really good commits sign on Signing Day, and had 20 guys.",-1,0
"Outside of a couple of guys, you really werent in the mix to sign anyone.",-1,0
"Kind of your big fish, that I would say, was Chris Steele, and everyone knew he was going to sign, but he wasnt going to announce a decision until January.",-1,0
"I think you still have to remember that in January.",-1,0
"If Chris Steele wants to go to Florida or wherever he goes, that was still a guy you were supposed to get on Signing Day.",-1,0

"Its so exciting when somebody commits in March for the next class, and then theyre forgotten about.",-1,0
"I think people want the big Signing Day fireworks and kind of forget about you had 17 kids who had already committed, and you liked them when they committed.",-1,0
"Just because there wasnt any drama doesnt make them a worse player.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 I mean, you look at Bamas class.",-1,0

"I mean, if you follow Gator Country youd have known that they were going to get all of them, but, you know, Nick.",-1,0

"It was a situation where Megan Mullen, and this was still a little bit new, her being around, that kind of stuff, but it was then that I really took notice, Nick, of how involved she was in recruiting and recruiting guys and parents and that kind of stuff.",-1,0
"She spent a lot of time during Friday Night Lights with Lloyd and with Keon, both of those guys.",-1,0
"Those guys didnt work out, and they were just all around her and talking to her.",-1,0
"That was a big moment for them, and it really stuck out.",-1,0
"Thats probably what ended up winning it for Florida was his relationship with Mullen and Miss Mullen and those guys around the staff.",-1,0
"Again, its like I said, its perception.",-1,0
"Then its what you said, next year they got one of the best running backs in the country in Demarkcus Bowman.",-1,0
"Floridas going to want to go get him, especially after missing on Trey Sanders.",-1,0
"You want to go get that.",-1,0
"Guess what?",-1,0
"Three of his buddies are there.",-1,0
"Hes going to be a frequent visitor to Gainesville.",-1,0
"We all know what that means.",-1,0
"Frequent visitor to Gainesville means more chances for the staff to sell him on the program.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Hey, buddy.",-1,0
"Theyre all friends.",-1,0
"Come see me play this week.",-1,0
"Come watch practice.",-1,0
"Just come and hang out.",-1,0
"I mean, Lakeland is about a two-hour drive.",-1,0
"Come and hang out this weekend.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Right.",-1,0
"Exactly.",-1,0
"Thats a big deal.",-1,0
"Again, it was such a huge win for Florida.",-1,0
"I guess, lets talk, Nick, now about the miss in Trey Sanders.",-1,0
"I said this to someone.",-1,0
"I dont mean this to sound bad towards the staff or towards anyone, so when I say this I want to keep it in context here a little bit.",-1,0
"Had Florida not had Umstead on campus, I dont even know if this recruitment involves Florida towards the end.",-1,0
"It was just Florida took a chance.",-1,0
"They took his brother, and I think his brother ended up being okay this year on special teams and that kind of stuff.",-1,0
"It was a situation where Florida was battling so far uphill, because of the relationship he had with Alabama for so long.",-1,0
"I mean, he was committed there as a freshman.",-1,0
"His parents were very comfortable.",-1,0
"Theres been zero change with Nick Saban there.",-1,0
"I just think it was such a big uphill battle.",-1,0
"Florida being there at the final four was great and all, and, listen, there is zero credit, zero wins you take away from being second in anybodys recruitment.",-1,0
"I mean, youre last.",-1,0
"You dont get the kid.",-1,0
"Just to have Umstead on campus helped them at least get a visit and at least be in the mix of things.",-1,0
"I never really got the sense at any point in his recruitment, Nick, that he was leaning towards Florida.",-1,0
"Thats no disrespect to the staff.",-1,0
"Im not trying to say anything bad about the staff.",-1,0
"Im just saying Florida missed on him on Signing Day, but I dont know if they missed on him, because I dont know if they were ever really truly in the mix for him.",-1,0
"I never got a vibe, and I never had anyone just straight up tell me, Florida is going to get Trey Sanders.",-1,0
"Nick:                         No.",-1,0
"That was part of it.",-1,0
"I think, I guess this is before the Lakeland kids.",-1,0
"It was when Siaki Ika, make sure I pronounce that, when he chose LSU, and I understand because he was on campus last week the excitement, but Florida recruited him for what?",-1,0
"17 days?",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Yeah.",-1,0
"Well hit on him in a second.",-1,0
"I just wanted to kind of finish that with Trey.",-1,0
"Like you were getting at, having his brother on campus was great and all, but at the end of the day, dad was the one really running Treys recruitment, and dad and Florida never got together.",-1,0
"His dad is an FSU fan, and that didnt help.",-1,0
"It just, I get the point that people are upset they missed on Trey Sanders, and hes an instate guy.",-1,0
"I get that.",-1,0
"Florida shouldnt be losing those guys.",-1,0
"In order to become a top program, like an Alabama or Georgia thats competing to go to the playoff every year, theyve got to start landing guys like Trey Sanders, guys like Evan Neal.",-1,0
"Im just saying that Florida was working so far behind there that they never gained momentum.",-1,0
"The previous staff had zero relationship or ties or anything with Trey, so Trey wasnt even around Florida that much.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Right.",-1,0
"Well, the point I was making with Siaki and then with Trey is that its just, back to what we touched on before, that perception.",-1,0
"I think if people are listening to you, then maybe youre not holding your breath.",-1,0
"Youre not getting your hopes up for Trey.",-1,0
"If you go into it with the right mindset of hed be nice, but we already have a great class, and like you just said, if you have the knowledge, and if youre reading the things that youre writing, you have the knowledge of it would be awesome if Trey came.",-1,0
"It would unexpected.",-1,0
"That would be awesome, but that doesnt ruin the class.",-1,0
"I dont think its a huge miss, because of those things you just said.",-1,0
"They were fighting an uphill battle, because of what they were left and what they had to work with, with the last staff and the relationship.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Exactly.",-1,0
"Well go to Siaki now.",-1,0
"First of all, again, there is no wins in recruiting.",-1,0
"You either win it, or you dont get.",-1,0
"You dont get points.",-1,0
"You dont get credit.",-1,0
"Nothing for that.",-1,0
"Guess what?",-1,0
"Youre still going to have to play the kids.",-1,0
"For Florida just to be in the mix have it come down to literally the 15 minutes before Siaki announced on Wednesday, just for Florida to be in that conversation, to me, says enough about Mullen and his staff to know that once they build relationships with guys they are going to be just fine.",-1,0
"I know some people say, he was all LSU, but he wasnt all LSU.",-1,0
"Nick, I was texting you beforehand, and youre my witness on this.",-1,0
"He still hadnt told the coaching staff.",-1,0
"His brothers sitting her telling me its still 50/50.",-1,0
"We went to sleep disagree on where we were going to go, because they were doing it as a family.",-1,0
"Different things.",-1,0
"Theres even the report out that Florida had more points on their scale than LSU did.",-1,0
"It was just simply LSU had the longer relationship with them.",-1,0
"They had been to Baton Rouge more, that kind of stuff.",-1,0
"For me, just to say that they were in the mix for a guy that they really had on campus one week and hadnt been fully, I mean, theyve been talking to him a little bit off and on, but fully recruiting for a couple weeks now.",-1,0
"Just, to me, says enough about this staff to say, okay, once they start getting relationships, theyre going to be okay.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yup.",-1,0
"We talk about that.",-1,0
"Shoot.",-1,0
"We talked about that until were blue in the face, about relationships.",-1,0
"You hit the nail on the head right there.",-1,0
"The relationship that Trey Sanders had with Alabama goes back to his freshman year.",-1,0
"Trey Sanders was never going to go to Mississippi State, so thats a guy that Mullen and his staff probably sent him some information, sent him some nice letters, but dont really go after him, because thats not a Mississippi, Trey Sanders was not a Mississippi State player.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 First of all, how proud are you that I can say Siaki?",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yeah.",-1,0
"Thats fantastic.",-1,0
"Well spend the rest of the podcast with Andrew just saying Siaki.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 I like that name.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Over and over and over again.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 I was getting excited to saying Siakis name.",-1,0
"My first pick of the game is going to be Siaki.",-1,0
"I was going to get some Siaki sacks, but hes going to LSU.",-1,0
"Nick:                         I was going to say, Andrew, hes redshirting.",-1,0
"I dont care.",-1,0
"I just wanted to say it.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Stephen A Smith gets paid millions of dollars to pick guys that arent even going to play.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Thats a mystery to me.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Why cant I?",-1,0
"So, I mean, that was there.",-1,0
"For me, Nick, and this is going to sound crazy when I say this, because it was expected but unexpected with Derick Hunter.",-1,0
"Anybody whos followed his recruitment, Nick, knew he was going to pull some kind of shenaz out on Signing Day that expected, and he did.",-1,0
"He did.",-1,0
"On Tuesday he was going to Miami at one point.",-1,0
"He was going to Florida at one point.",-1,0
"He was going to Texas A&amp;M at one point.",-1,0
"He had told all those schools no, yes, no, yes, multiple times.",-1,0
"Went to bed saying he was going to Miami, according to people around him.",-1,0
"Woke up going back to Texas A&amp;M. No surprise to Derick Hunter.",-1,0
"Now, that was a guy that I think that if you want to point at one guy that you said Florida should have gotten him, it would have been Derick Hunter.",-1,0
"Now, knowing Derick Hunters recruitment, who knew what he was going to do?",-1,0
"I mean, he was committed to FSU, and he had a top three that didnt FSU in it.",-1,0
"Thats Derick Hunters recruitment.",-1,0
"Its a miss for Florida simply because he was a very good defensive end prospect, and he admitted before that he had the best relationship with Sal Sunseri, and they just, dad wanted him to go to A&amp;M, and dad wasnt in favor of Florida.",-1,0
"He went to A&amp;M.
That would be the one, Nick, out of yesterdays announcements on Wednesday, that I would say probably hurt the most.",-1,0
"But knowing his recruitment, who knew what to expect?",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yeah.",-1,0
"You dont like to see a kid from Fort Myers, a kid that youre going to go after, a kid that you really like, you dont like to see them go out of state, especially to an SEC school.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Right.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Not one that youre going to be playing anytime soon, but you dont like to see him go to an SEC school.",-1,0
"There was another kid, just on Thursday, FSU lost another one.",-1,0
"Whats his name?",-1,0
"Putnam.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Yes.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Will Putnam.",-1,0
"From Tampa Plant.",-1,0
"He goes up and goes to Clemson.",-1,0
"Clemsons done a really good job in that Tampa area.",-1,0
"I think thats something Dan Mullen, when you start talking about not just competing in the SEC, but competing nationally, I think thats something Mullen and the staff will look and be like, how do we get Clemson out of Tampa?",-1,0
"Because we need to be in Tampa.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Right.",-1,0
"Well talk about that here in a second with that.",-1,0
"Putnam was a guy that Hevesy wasnt high on, but FSU missed on him, because it was kind of FSU, Auburn, and Clemson.",-1,0
"They missed on him.",-1,0
"I mean, like I said with Hunter, if youre going to point to one guy that you thought Florida needed to get on Signing Day that they had the best shot with, it was Hunter, and he didnt go.",-1,0
"They missed on Brandon Dorlus.",-1,0
"He went to Oregon.",-1,0
"Florida recruited him for about a month really, and he went to Oregon.",-1,0
"They kind of got beat there on those defensive linemen.",-1,0
"I just wanted to focus on Trey more than anything, just because of that relationship there.",-1,0
"Well go into your point, Nick.",-1,0
"Its starting to lock down those areas that are Gator friendly.",-1,0
"For me, Nick, and you can correct me if you think differently here, but for me theres three major points in the state.",-1,0
"Thats Jacksonville, the Orlando area, and Tampa.",-1,0
"Those are the three areas that Florida has to lock down that are Gator friendly areas.",-1,0
"South Florida, nobodys going to lock down South Florida.",-1,0
"Everybody in the country recruits South Florida.",-1,0
"You would like to see Florida, Florida State, and Miami split those guys.",-1,0
"You and I both know thats never going to happen.",-1,0
"Alabama has got such a strong hold down there and everything else.",-1,0
"For me, Nick, its Jacksonville, that Orlando area, and I include Lakeland in that Orlando area, that corridor area down there, and then the Tampa area.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yeah.",-1,0
"That whole, its like that I-4 belt all the way through Central Florida.",-1,0
"Mullen said, basically, you put a dot on a map in Gainesville, and you draw a five-hour to six-hour radius.",-1,0
"I mean, that dips into some parts of Tennessee.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Right.",-1,0
"Atlanta.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yeah.",-1,0
"Atlanta is four hours from Gainesville, so Atlanta, that whole area, that South Georgia.",-1,0
"They have a bunch of kids from South Georgia.",-1,0
"Trey Dean, they got him last year.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Damien Pierce.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Jaelin Humphries, someone who Im really excited to see.",-1,0
"Hes from Lawrenceville.",-1,0
"Another one from Alpharetta in Jaden Hill.",-1,0
"Sorry, in Tyron Hopper.",-1,0
"To me, yeah, thats nice.",-1,0
"You want to go to South Georgia and dip into Alabama and those schools, but like you said, theres so much talent in the state of Florida and concentrated in Jacksonville, in South Florida, in Central Florida, and West Florida in Tampa and Lakeland.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Right.",-1,0
"For me, Nick, I say this, and Ive been very vocal on this.",-1,0
"I want to say, you have to focus on the state of Florida and concentrate your efforts on the state of Florida.",-1,0
"I get that, and you should.",-1,0
"Next year those three areas, mainly that we just talked about, are absolutely filthy rich with talent.",-1,0
"You got two DBs at Jacksonville Trinity Christian in Fred Davis and Miles Brook who are borderline, and I think Fred is already a five-star.",-1,0
"Theyll be top 100 kids.",-1,0
"You got Demarkcus Bowman at Lakeland, like we talked about.",-1,0
"You have those guys in those Gator rich territories that are big-time players next year.",-1,0
"For me, Nick, and I like what Dan says about that six-hour radius there, but I also, and well see what happens with Chris Steele.",-1,0
"Well see what happens with some other guys.",-1,0
"You see Jalon Jones from Richmond, Virginia.",-1,0
"When Florida is at the best, theyre able to recruit the top of the top nationally.",-1,0
"You look at what Michigan does.",-1,0
"They go out, and they recruited the kid from Oklahoma.",-1,0
"#1 safety in the country, Dax Hill.",-1,0
"You look what Bama does.",-1,0
"We just talked about it.",-1,0
"They go into South Florida and pick who they want.",-1,0
"They go to Texas.",-1,0
"When Florida is at the top of the echelon of football programs, theyre recruiting nationally.",-1,0
"Again, its recruiting the state of Florida and getting top players there, and then its cherry-picking the rest of the nation to pick out some guys.",-1,0
"For me, Im still cool with that.",-1,0
"I know some people are like, dont recruit California.",-1,0
"Listen, you have so many days to recruit.",-1,0
"Youre not wasting time recruiting those guys.",-1,0
"The biggest difference that they have to do better, I think, next year and in years to come is when they miss on a guy, like a Chris Steele the first time.",-1,0
"Have a good backup plan in the state.",-1,0
"They have to have backup plans.",-1,0
"Again, I say focus on the state of Florida, but also be ready to cherry-pick the rest of the country for the top of the top.",-1,0
"Nick:                         I think the biggest misconception is youre wasting time.",-1,0
"Talking to Chris Steele, or talking to a player from California, it doesnt mean youre talking to a guy in Tampa less.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Right.",-1,0
"I mean, lets just talk about this recruiting period that just ended.",-1,0
"They had three weeks where all the coaching staff was on the road.",-1,0
"Where would Charlton Warren have been had he not made that trip to California to see Chris Steele?",-1,0
"I mean, you know what I’m saying?",-1,0
"Okay.",-1,0
"Yeah, he wasted a day going out there to see him.",-1,0
"Who cares?",-1,0
"Okay.",-1,0
"He goes to Georgia and recruits somebody.",-1,0
"Who cares?",-1,0
"Theres other prospects there.",-1,0
"You wasted a day.",-1,0
"You waste 30 minutes of your phone call.",-1,0
"Have backup plans, that kind of stuff, but you have to still be able to cherry-pick the rest of the country when that Gator brand is popular and up in the top of the top of the country.",-1,0
"Nick, I think you will agree with me here.",-1,0
"Youre never going to be able to just lock down the state of Florida and get every top prospect there.",-1,0
"Other schools are coming.",-1,0
"Thats the same way with every other state.",-1,0
"No school is going to ever be able to lock down the state and get it.",-1,0
"You look at Georgia.",-1,0
"Georgia lost good players everywhere.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Agree with you 100% on all that.",-1,0
"I mean, you could annoy a kid, like our fans dont want me to go to California, so Im going to be at your house for the next four days.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Yeah.",-1,0
"Hey, Kaiir Elam, Im going to be at your house every day, because they told me I couldnt go recruit Chris Steele.",-1,0
"Okay.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Were actually neighbors.",-1,0
"We bought the house next to you.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 I cant come to your house, but Im going to need you to go to the mailbox every day, and well have a good conversation at the mailbox while were checking our mail.",-1,0
"Throw the newspaper out there, and make Elam step over to your driveway and have a conversation over there.",-1,0
"Again, recruit the state of Florida.",-1,0
"Theres zero question marks for me about it.",-1,0
"I mean, the state of Florida, year in and year out, has up there with California and Texas as the most prospects that go D1 and most prospects that go in the NFL and that kind of stuff.",-1,0
"So, you got to lock down that area, and youve got to lock down that Gator rich territories.",-1,0
"You have to get Ohio State out of Jacksonville.",-1,0
"Youve got to get Clemson out of Tampa.",-1,0
"Youve got to get the other schools out of the Orlando area as well and keep them away.",-1,0
"If you lose a Central Florida kid to Miami, you say okay.",-1,0
"If you lose a Central Florida kid to Georgia, you get pissed off.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yeah.",-1,0
"Thats true.",-1,0
"Probably just pissed off no matter what.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 I mean, youre pissed off no matter what, but Im saying its not okay to lose them to Miami or Florida State, but youve got to get these other out of state schools out of there and do that.",-1,0
"Some people have said the staff has some weak links.",-1,0
"Every staff has weak links, Nick.",-1,0
"Every staff has weak links.",-1,0
"Now, is there some guys on this coaching staff that need to step it up a little bit?",-1,0
"Absolutely.",-1,0
"100%.",-1,0
"Some people are upset about Billy Gonzales with his receiver recruitment.",-1,0
"Look what he did last year.",-1,0
"Okay?",-1,0
"Does he need to get better in 2020 and get better players?",-1,0
"Absolutely.",-1,0
"But that wasnt a position of need.",-1,0
"Sal Sunseri is the same way.",-1,0
"He has a position of need.",-1,0
"Hes going to have his work cut out for him in February.",-1,0
"Theres some guys that have got to improve.",-1,0
"Its still Year 1.",-1,0
"Theyve still got to make those relationships in the state of Florida, like you said.",-1,0
"A lot of those guys in the state of Florida werent going to Mississippi State.",-1,0
"Theyre playing from behind.",-1,0
"2020, 2021, you got to start throwing that card out, because youve had a year.",-1,0
"Youve got to make up time.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yeah.",-1,0
"Thats a built-in excuse really with any coach that comes in.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Right.",-1,0
"Nick:                         But, like you said, 2021.",-1,0
"The class is really strong in 2020, and theyve already started the 2021 class, so those excuses arent there anymore, because now youve had, at that point, two and three years to build those relationships and to get on the same level as a Kirby Smart, whos been at Georgia for three years, and Nick Saban, whos been at Alabama ever since he lied to the Dolphins.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Again, Nick, I say this, and we always talk about how one game can do this or do that.",-1,0
"Im not a big believer in that one game will sway a kid or anything like that, but I do believe in seasons.",-1,0
"Florida had a successful good football season this year, and that should end up playing a big part for things.",-1,0
"Look what its done in the underclassman classes, the 2021 class and the 2020 class.",-1,0
"Those are big.",-1,0
"Youve got to build on that and take that momentum that you have as well and start building into that 2020 class, that 2021 class, and go in there and do it.",-1,0
"You go into that Michigan game in the Chick-Fil-A Peach Bowl and get some momentum there to hope to finish out this 2019 class strong.",-1,0
"Thats kind of where I wanted to go next, Nick.",-1,0
"Dan Mullen said it on Wednesday in his press conference.",-1,0
"Defensive line and secondary.",-1,0
"Those are the two biggest things that this staff has got to do till February.",-1,0
"Ill ask you, who follows the team much, much closer than I do, would you agree with Mullen that thats the focus, or the need I guess, after youve looked at whats on paper and then what you saw last year from the team?",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yeah.",-1,0
"I think right now, to me the biggest concern would be that interior defensive line.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Okay.",-1,0
"Nick:                         I mean, youve got a couple.",-1,0
"Youve got five linebackers already signed.",-1,0
"Those are a couple bucks.",-1,0
"You need to sign a big linebacker class, because youre going to lose Vosean Joseph and David Reese.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Next year.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Next year.",-1,0
"After next season.",-1,0
"Then at that point, James Houston is a redshirt junior.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Right.",-1,0
"Nick:                         So, you needed to have a big class.",-1,0
"You need to refill that buck position, because I do think youre going to lose Jachai Polite.",-1,0
"Whats Jeremiah Moon?",-1,0
"Hes going to be a redshirt?",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Junior.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Junior?",-1,0
"I thought that was a big position of need, and they needed to hit, and they did.",-1,0
"To me, its defensive tackle.",-1,0
"You look at the defensive line.",-1,0
"You got Jalen Humphries.",-1,0
"Hes a great prospect, great player, but thats it.",-1,0
"You miss on 
Andrew:                 Hes got a knee injury too that hes still coming back from.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yeah.",-1,0
"I mean, youre still going to have guys at defensive tackle, but you need to get depth.",-1,0
"You need to get, in my opinion, if you get three, I dont think three is too much.",-1,0
"Sign three in February.",-1,0
"Youve got to figure out a way to get that depth, and not just depth, but to get some talent on the interior defensive line.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Yeah.",-1,0
"I think, and you and I have talked about this, and I dont want to get too much into it and away from things, but the Conliffes of the world, the Kyrie Campbells of the world, havent performed to the best.",-1,0
"Thats nothing against those guys.",-1,0
"They just havent.",-1,0
"So, theres competition there.",-1,0
"I would agree with you, Nick.",-1,0
"You got some defensive ends there, and I think you can still get another one in the class as well, but if youre able to go out and really sign that monster D tackle guy, like a Nathan Pickering, thats where things could improve for Florida and get better there.",-1,0
"That, to me, is a big key.",-1,0
"Then I say this, and I mean no bad feelings towards anyone, but Florida needs depth.",-1,0
"You cannot go into playing Georgia again with CJ McWilliams as the starting cornerback.",-1,0
"Nick:                         No.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Thats bad to say, and I hate to say it.",-1,0
"I hate to call anyone out, but it is what it is.",-1,0
"So far, youve signed Jaden Hill, and you signed Chester Kimbrough.",-1,0
"You got some other guys out there, and Ill run through those guys real quick here.",-1,0
"These are four guys that have said either they will visit, or a guy like Chris Steele, who is going to announce the decision soon and early enroll.",-1,0
"You got Chris Steele out there.",-1,0
"I still really like Floridas chances over Oregon there.",-1,0
"You have Elam, Kaiir Elam.",-1,0
"Hes a guy whos going to visit in January.",-1,0
"Its them or Georgia.",-1,0
"Then you have two Florida State commits, Travis Jay and Akeem Dent, two guys that have been long commits to FSU that have said theyre going to visit, or may visit.",-1,0
"Excuse me.",-1,0
"That would be key, especially with Jay, whos a safety.",-1,0
"I think, Nick, that while they need another corner to two in the class, they also need a safety in this class.",-1,0
"Really, Nick, outside of Brad Stewart, safety play was bad last year.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yeah.",-1,0
"Brad Stewart losing time towards the end of the year.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 After the suspension.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yeah.",-1,0
"I dont really know.",-1,0
"I mean, youre going to get Jaewon Taylor back, but, no, I agree with you.",-1,0
"You need to go back and to hit that safety spot, especially when you look at kind of how the defensive backfield, or sorry, the secondary was hit with injuries this year.",-1,0
"You got to think, shoot, if that happens again next year, whos playing?",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Right.",-1,0
"I mean, I said this too, and I want to see a healthy Shawn Davis.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yeah.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 I do.",-1,0
"I want to see a healthy Shawn Davis, see what he can do when healthy as well.",-1,0
"I had high hopes for him heading into the season, so I want to see a healthy Shawn Davis.",-1,0
"Thats a big key for me, Nick, is signing a safety.",-1,0
"Then I wanted to run through those defensive line targets real quick here.",-1,0
"Quashon Fuller is an FSU commit.",-1,0
"Going to visit in January.",-1,0
"Two Mississippi State commits to watch, Nathan Pickering that weve talked about, and another guy who hasnt visited yet but is thinking about visiting in January is Charles Moore, another defensive tackle commit.",-1,0
"Then an Alabama commit in Byron Young.",-1,0
"Didnt sign on Wednesday.",-1,0
"Hes worried about all the numbers.",-1,0
"I mean, Alabama has a humongous defensive line class, and he already visited Florida on an official, so Florida needs to get him back on unofficial.",-1,0
"Then a guy whos a late rising guy whos more of a basketball guy but is a good player who had a really good senior year is Smith Gilbert.",-1,0
"Has a top four of Penn State, Florida, Syracuse, and Oregon.",-1,0
"Going to visit Florida on January 11th.",-1,0
"Thats a big one as well.",-1,0
"Again, I say this, I say those names.",-1,0
"Theres going to be more names pop up.",-1,0
"Did last year.",-1,0
"Will this year.",-1,0
"Will next year.",-1,0
"Will the year after that.",-1,0
"Will do it forever and ever.",-1,0
"Just always is.",-1,0
"With this early signing period, guys start looking at more guys.",-1,0
"Guys start looking at guys who didnt sign early, that kind of stuff, so youll see plenty of new names pop up on the board.",-1,0
"Some will visit, some wont.",-1,0
"Again, I like your point, Nick, and say I think those guys will be defensive tackles, and it will be guys that are defensive backs that are either corners or safeties.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Got to go after a few.",-1,0
"I mean, this class right now is at 20, so the spots are limited.",-1,0
"The good thing is everyone is kind of in that limited spots, but go after it.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Right.",-1,0
"Exactly.",-1,0
"I mean, there is some talk that Florida could possibly go over 20.",-1,0
"Well see if that happens.",-1,0
"Again, you got to start getting some guys on.",-1,0
"I have to mention one more name, Nick, and its a guy on the offensive side of the ball that maybe, its a receiver, athlete, really good player.",-1,0
"Mark-Antony Richards, Nick.",-1,0
"Hes a guy that has been on the board.",-1,0
"Has been one of Floridas top targets.",-1,0
"Dan Mullen loves Mark-Antony Richards and is a guy thats going to visit in January.",-1,0
"Florida, Auburn, Miami battle there.",-1,0
"So, huge name there.",-1,0
"Huge player that Dan Mullen wants.",-1,0
"A guy Florida has really gained momentum with, kind of that Kadarius Toney guy thats just an athlete, play anywhere you want him to.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Shoot.",-1,0
"Kadarius Toney.",-1,0
"Where has time gone with him?",-1,0
"Hes going to be gone soon.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Yeah.",-1,0
"Youve got to start replacing.",-1,0
"You and I, Nick, we know, weve watched it growing up, and when we were watching Urban and everything else, and that is Florida and Dan Mullen like those athletes that can play anywhere.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yeah.",-1,0
"That would be one to me thats interesting, an athlete not in the same mold as a Kadarius Toney, but Trent Whittemore.",-1,0
"Right here, from Gainesville.",-1,0
"Hes played everything.",-1,0
"Not just played every position in football, but played basketball, played baseball.",-1,0
"Maybe wrestled.",-1,0
"I mean, shoot, he does everything.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 He might even be swimming.",-1,0
"Nick:                         One thing Dan Mullen said yesterday that I really hadnt considered about, because Whittemore is a big kid, 63, 187 pounds, but he said he loves that he plays that many sports.",-1,0
"He said, but because of that, hes never really lifted weights seriously.",-1,0
"Like Florida, the football team, once the off season starts, thats their building phase.",-1,0
"Thats where theyre putting on muscle and losing fat and getting bigger and getting stronger.",-1,0
"When youre in season, youre in a maintaining phase.",-1,0
"Whittemore doesnt have an off season.",-1,0
"Football ends and basketball goes on.",-1,0
"Then basketball ends, and baseball starts.",-1,0
"When baseball ends, its back to football season.",-1,0
"So, hes never really had that.",-1,0
"Hes somebody Id be interested to see where he fits.",-1,0
"Is he going to be on offense?",-1,0
"Is he going to be on defense?",-1,0
"Whats he going to look like after three months with Nick Savage?",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Thats a good point, for real.",-1,0
"A guy for me though, Nick, and were talking about guys that Im eager to see.",-1,0
"Im eager to see what Zipperer does as that H-back.",-1,0
"I just dont think Florida has one on that roster.",-1,0
"I could be wrong, Nick, and you may disagree with me there.",-1,0
"I dont think they have a true H-back that they can use.",-1,0
"For all the stuff aside, and RIP, but they havent had a guy like Aaron Hernandez that was that H-back that was a true guy that could just catch the ball and go inside the tackle box and outside the tackle box.",-1,0
"Nick:                         I was talking with Tate Casey, and he said he thinks he is perfect.",-1,0
"He thinks that Keon Zipperer is perfect skillset wise for this offense.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 I wouldnt disagree with that at all.",-1,0
"I think that thats a guy that when youre looking at seeing a guy who can really do everything its Keon Zipperer there.",-1,0
"Well break this down a lot more, guys on each side of the ball that were looking forward to seeing and that kind of stuff.",-1,0
"I wanted to kind of hit around some teams around the country, especially in state of Florida.",-1,0
"Florida State, what are you doing?",-1,0
"Lose your quarterback.",-1,0
"You lose Derick Hunter.",-1,0
"Willie Taggert is over her promising #1 class and loses Will Putnam.",-1,0
"What are you doing?",-1,0
"Nick:                         I guess the recruiting was lethally simple as well.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 I guess so.",-1,0
"I mean, no bowl game for them.",-1,0
"You get all that, and you still cant make that happen.",-1,0
"What are you doing up there?",-1,0
"Nick:                         Its a rough time out West.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Yeah.",-1,0
"Then down south in Miami.",-1,0
"What are you doing?",-1,0
"What are you doing, Mark?",-1,0
"Nick:                         Losing a quarterback.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Losing your quarterback.",-1,0
"You wasted all that time in Lakeland that you were bragging about, talking about how this was a great day.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Love recruiting Lakeland.",-1,0
"Not anymore.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Yeah.",-1,0
"Not no more.",-1,0
"You do all that, and its kind of like, what are you doing?",-1,0
"What are you doing over there, Mark?",-1,0
"Then, Nick, the guy who almost was the football coach of the University of Florida, Chip Kelly not ranked in the team rankings.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Is that good?",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Its not very good.",-1,0
"One ESPN top 300 kid.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Theres going to be some buyers remorse out West, I feel.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Out West as in Tallahassee?",-1,0
"Nick:                         No.",-1,0
"Well, yes.",-1,0
"But I meant way out West in UCLA.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 I was going to say.",-1,0
"Yeah.",-1,0
"You look at that, and, man, thats some bad things thats going on around the country, for sure.",-1,0
"Alabama does well.",-1,0
"Auburn does well.",-1,0
"Georgia does well.",-1,0
"Tennessee had a pretty good bounce back class as well.",-1,0
"A lot of good things there.",-1,0
"Nick, I wanted to get one final thought in real quick, before we kind of move on here.",-1,0
"That is while the recruiting is over with for right now, and theyre focused on the bowl game, these guys are also looking at that transfer market.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yeah.",-1,0
"Its open season right now.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Yeah.",-1,0
"Open season.",-1,0
"Go get them.",-1,0
"My favorite player, Nick, Justin Fields.",-1,0
"Back on the market.",-1,0
"Nick:                         That was so interesting to me, the way that Kirby said it yesterday.",-1,0
"It was like he plans on being here and playing in the Sugar Bowl and practicing, while also seeing where else he can go.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Hes not fully invested in his program.",-1,0
"Nick:                         To me, listen, Justin Fields is a good kid.",-1,0
"We both talked to him multiple times throughout his recruiting process.",-1,0
"Hes a good kid.",-1,0
"To me, if youre going to leave, just leave.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Yeah.",-1,0
"Thats kind of my thing too, Nick.",-1,0
"I think Kirby is in an interesting situation here a little bit too, because do you tell him, leave?",-1,0
"Do you force his hand a little bit here and say, I dont want you around my program, leave?",-1,0
"How do you handle that if youre Kirby Smart?",-1,0
"I think hes in an interesting predicament as well.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yeah.",-1,0
"Stop signing the best quarterback in every class.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Well.",-1,0
"You got to be able to deal with it like old Nicky does in T-Town.",-1,0
"Any final thoughts, Nick, before we get out of here?",-1,0
"This will be our last podcast before the holidays.",-1,0
"We do hope everyone has a good holiday.",-1,0
"Nick, youll be arriving in Atlanta a little before I will.",-1,0
"Then Ill be following you up.",-1,0
"Be up in Atlanta, then Ill be heading down to Under Armour for the Under Armour game on the 30th, or for practice.",-1,0
"Ill be heading down there for the first day of practice on that 30th.",-1,0

"Well be heading down there doing all that.",-1,0
"Well be having coverage of both going on.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yeah.",-1,0
"Be back to back.",-1,0
"Michigan has, I think, three players out now.",-1,0
"Their best running back, Higdon, isnt playing.",-1,0
"That adds to their two best defensive players not playing in the bowl game, so not a lot of room to lose this game and have any kind of excuse right now, when youre looking at a team thats going to be without three of their best players.",-1,0
"Andrew:                 Time to go up there and put a foot on the throat and get a win.",-1,0
"Nick:                         Yup.",-1,0

SINGAPORE (Reuters) – Singapore’s consumer price index probably rose 0.6 percent in November from a year earlier, a Reuters poll showed, slowing slightly from 0.7 percent in the month before.",-1,0
"The poll also showed that the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) core inflation measure likely increased 1.9 percent from a year earlier in November, unchanged from the previous month.",-1,0
"Irvin Seah, a senior economist with Singapore’s biggest lender DBS, said the expected CPI dip was partly technical – due to a high reading last November – and could also be impacted by slipping oil prices and a supply glut in the domestic car market.",-1,0
"“The CPI inflation numbers have been pretty sluggish in the last few months,” Seah, who is predicting a 0.6 percent y/y reading for November, said.",-1,0
"Oil prices have this week hit their lowest in more than a year on worries about oversupply and the outlook for energy demand.",-1,0

The central bank’s core inflation measure – which excludes changes in the price of cars and accommodation – is seen as a gauge more closely watched by policymakers who have tightened policy in both of their semi-annual meetings this year.",-1,0
"At its meeting in October, MAS said the city-state’s economy is likely to expand steadily barring a setback to global growth from trade frictions between the United States and China.",-1,0
"“Core inflation remains fairly steady…so nothing that would cause the MAS to back down from their current policy,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank in Singapore.",-1,0

The MAS’ next scheduled policy meeting is in April 2019.",-1,0
