"THE global floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) demand looks promising, with new potential floating production requirements and progressing developments in projects coming on board.",-1,0
"According to an industry source, it is estimated that 30 FPSO projects could arrive at the final investment decision stage next year, resulting in more contract awards.",-1,0
"However, it is likely that some of the projects, particularly those in Africa, Brazil and India, could be delayed.",-1,0
"“In South-East Asia, we reckon that four floating storage and offloading (FSO) leased units could be deployed next year,” he said.",-1,0
"Since 2014, Bumi Armada Bhd has not bagged a new FPSO contract.",-1,0
"As of Sept 30, Bumi Armada has a firm order book value of RM21bil, with additional optional extensions of up to RM10.3bil.",-1,0
"On the other hand, its peer Yinson Holdings Bhd has secured one project this year – the FPSO Helang charter contract, formerly known as Layang.",-1,0
"The project was taken over from TH Heavy Engineering Bhd and has an aggregate value of US$860mil (RM3.37bil).",-1,0
"As of May 31, Yinson’s order book amounts to US$4.3bil (RM17.38bil) which provides earnings visibility until 2037.",-1,0
"According to AmInvestment Bank Research, Yinson remains hopeful of securing at least another FPSO contract potentially costing US$1bil over the next 12 months.",-1,0
"This comes on the back of multiple developments in Brazil, West Africa and Mexico where there is a limited pool of contenders with the necessary track record and financial capability following the severe industry downturn over the past three years.",-1,0
"Analysts opine that Yinson has better financials compared with Bumi Armada, given its better-managed debts and project financing approach.",-1,0
"“Yinson, as an FPSO owner, is usually protected against contract termination risks, as seen in the termination of its US$1bil charter contract for its FPSO in Vietnam.",-1,0
"“Its charter rates are also highly reliable and predictable source of cash flow as the rates are not linked to oil and gas prices nor to the field performance on which the FPSO operates,” an analyst says.",-1,0
"The analyst adds that Yinson’s termination fees are typically contractually structured and calculated based on the present value of lost future revenues payable as lump sum payments.",-1,0
"In a recent report, UOB Kay Hian Research says it continues to like the group’s long-term potential, being a major beneficiary of FPSO bids globally, and potential opportunities with its strategic partners.",-1,0
"This is despite Yinson’s premium valuation, which currently trades at a price-earnings multiple of 16.54 times.",-1,0

"MALAYAN Banking Bhd (Maybank) Singapore appears not to be taking any chances when it comes to the ever-changing role of banks.",-1,0
"It has devised strategies which it hopes will continue to keep the lender relevant in the city-state where it is just one of the many hundreds of financial institutions hungry for a bigger slice of the pie.",-1,0
"Maybank Singapore CEO John Lee Hin Hock makes no qualms in saying that, while what banks currently do is necessary, the big question is whether people actually need banks to do these things.",-1,0
"“You take whatever we do today, for example, we give loans and take deposits.",-1,0
"But (now) we have crowdfunding and P2Ps (peer to peer), so we don’t need banks anymore right?",-1,0
"“I think every bank is asking that question – so in a lot of the things you see we are doing, we are conscious of the fact that if we don’t evolve, we will basically disappear,” he tells StarBizWeek matter-of-factly, at Maybank’s headquarters in Kuala Lumpur earlier this week.",-1,0
"In his first exclusive interview with Malaysian media since assuming the head honcho role at Maybank Singapore a year ago, Lee, who was previously Maybank group chief risk officer, knows that he has his work cut out for him.",-1,0
"Especially so, in an extremely competitive market like Singapore.",-1,0
"“Singapore is a very different market from Malaysia; the main difference is that the Singapore market is a world stage.",-1,0
"“Malaysia is still a close market.",-1,0
"You look at the (number) of players here, it is limited, it is not as open as in Singapore where anyone can come in.” One of the strategies that he is contemplating to employ is a “re-modelling” of Maybank’s Singapore branches, which total 20, in all.",-1,0
"“We want to re-design our branches so that people come to our branches but how do we make people come to our branches?",-1,0
"“If I give you an offering, you might want to come right?",-1,0
"The question is what (is the offering) and how do we engage our customers.” The bank recently launched MSpace, a test branch or what it calls a concept branch – which combines bank, cafe and customer engagement sessions – in the hopes of finding that elusive answer.",-1,0
"Another strategy he is toying with is to hire psychologists to join the bank so as to better understand consumer behaviour.",-1,0
"Maybank Singapore’s earnings currently make up about 10% to 12% of the lender’s overall profits, making it the second largest contributor after Malaysia which generates around 70% of the group’s profits.",-1,0
"Its third largest profit contributor is Indonesia.",-1,0
"The bank’s significance in Singapore, where it is one out of at least 180 other financial institutions, was given a boost recently when it was given approval to locally incorporate its community financial services business.",-1,0
"Lee says moving forward, growth will come primarily from several areas such as wealth management, capitalising on Singapore’s position as a financial hub.",-1,0
"Its wealth management business, which includes private and premier banking services, has seen double-digit growth over the past five years since it was set up, thanks to growing affluence.",-1,0
"The group started its private wealth business in Singapore before expanding it to Malaysia and Hong Kong.",-1,0
"Currently, its private banking assets under management (AUM) total US$10bil.",-1,0
"For comparison sake, UBS, which is the largest wealth manager in the Asian region as well as having a strong presence in Singapore, has a total AUM of US$382bil as at the end of 2017, according to Asia Private Banker.",-1,0
"Private banking “very, very competitive” Lee says the focus for now is growing the premier banking market (defined as accounts with deposits and or investments above S$300,000) as opposed to private banking (above S$1.5mil).",-1,0
"He points out that private banking in Singapore is a “very, very competitive” market with the presence of far more established global players the likes of UBS, Credit Suisse and JP Morgan.",-1,0
"“Where I think we can create a stronger niche is the premier market as this is focused on people with newer wealth creation,” he says, adding that these individuals are obviously less demanding with products for them not having to be too complex in nature.",-1,0
"“The premier market, we talk about the more plain-vanilla stuff, more generic, as opposed to alternative investments like wine and art for private banking...” Profit margins are also “better” for the premier banking segment, he adds, without citing figures, as the cost to serve is “cheaper”.",-1,0
"“Basically, we need to increase our fee-based income.",-1,0
"I think if you look at Maybank, a lot of our business still comes from interest income or fund-income.",-1,0
"So we want to grow our fee-income – wealth management is one, the other is trade.",-1,0
"“Singapore is a trading hub and our strength is trying to connect the trade corridors in Asean, that’s fee income for us.” Lee says there’s a conscious effort to also try to do its business “better” with emphasis on a more competitive funding base.",-1,0
"“There is a lot of competition for deposits/funds in Singapore, there is always a fight going on.",-1,0
"“People are able to move money very easily.",-1,0
"In a blink of an eye you are able to move money from one bank to another with very little cost, if any at all, so we need to be smarter on how to attract people when creating products.",-1,0
"“If we pay up, we will get the FDs (fixed deposits) but that will increase our funding cost... we compete if we have to but what we want to do is be a bit more creative.” On investment banking deals, Lee says that previously, the lender did not really see it as an area that it wanted to focus on too much.",-1,0
"“But now we do and we believe that there’s a lot more that we can do.” He says no specific growth or earnings targets have been set as yet for the Singapore unit, which for the nine months ended September 2018 reported a net income of S$844.94mil, 12.3% higher than what it made in the previous corresponding period.",-1,0
"“Now that we are locally incorporated, we probably will have our own targets but these have not been worked through yet.” Nevertheless, Lee says the aim is to be a “more significant” contributor and a more “meaningful” business to the group.",-1,0
"“Our group has always said that we aim for a 40% contribution from all overseas markets but I think while we have set that target, the Malaysian business has also grown.",-1,0
"So in that sense, we need to grow faster overseas to be able to catch up with that growth.” Notably, Maybank is one of the few Malaysian banks with a presence in Singapore.",-1,0
"It is the fourth largest bank by asset size in South-East Asia.",-1,0
"While the top three positions belong to Singapore banks – DBS, OCBC and UOB – the fifth largest is another Malaysian lender, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd.",-1,0
"But Lee doesn’t quite consider Malaysian peers like CIMB his closest rival nor is he focused on taking on Malaysian business, per se.",-1,0
"“Every bank in Singapore is a competitor.",-1,0
"We are not so focused on CIMB or RHB (which also has a presence there), we compete with DBS, OCBC and UOB.",-1,0
"In fact, 80% of our revenue in Singapore is from Singapore businesses.” “Sufficient provisions” for Hyflux Investors who track Maybank Singapore will recall that one of the thorns in its flesh this year was its link to Singapore-listed water treatment firm Hyflux, once the darling of investors.",-1,0
"The company, started by Malaysian-born Olivia Lum, received its fair share of flak this year, largely due to debt issues and the need for a business reorganisation.",-1,0
"Its stock has since been suspended.",-1,0
"Maybank is Hyflux’s sole secured creditor for its loss-making Tuaspring water and power plant.",-1,0
"Just this Tuesday, Hyflux obtained its third extension of a deadline to find a purchaser for the plant.",-1,0
"Maybank, in turn, has agreed to a deadline of Dec 28, from Nov 29 previously.",-1,0
"On this, Lee says that provisions have been made in the previous financial quarters and are sufficient thus far.",-1,0
"He says the lender is not expecting any other provisions out of the ordinary, moving forward, and its exposure to sectors like property and oil and gas, which have been less than favourable in recent years, are not too much of a concern.",-1,0
"“In the banking market, provisions are always there, more so under FRS 9.",-1,0
"Basically we have to foresee what the market will look like and we have to provide based on that prediction but there’s nothing out of the ordinary.” Open banking On trends, he says there are a few banking patterns that are set to, or rather in places like Singapore, already picking up pace.",-1,0
"“One is the whole digitalisation idea.",-1,0
"People are making decisions using different data sets, using artificial intelligence is another one, there are also people experimenting with blockchain.” Lee says because of digitalisation and automation, the truth is that the banking sector, like many others, is going to need less and less human beings to do its work.",-1,0
"“Most banks are probably hiring less and less fresh graduates because of this.",-1,0
"From a personnel cost perspective, you will see a downtrend but investments in technology will increase.” The second big trend, he says, surrounds the concept of open banking.",-1,0
"“In Europe and the UK, they have already adopted this whereby open banking means the data of customers – with their consent – must be shared by all parties which are allowed to come into the banking system.” This concept changes the way in which banks handle the financial information of its customers because it means the bank – with the consent of individuals – must share data which show the spending, lending and borrowing patterns of its customers with other parties.",-1,0
"The idea behind this is to spur innovation, competition and transparency.",-1,0
"What Singapore is trying to do is to make it a little more controlled for now, Lee says.",-1,0
"“As a bank, you can basically be displaced if you don’t do anything about this but if you do it well, you can attract customers.",-1,0
"For Maybank, we have more to gain than lose because today, we only have about 4% to 5% of the market.",-1,0
"“DBS, OCBC and UOB collectively have about 70% of the market, so basically we can attract their customers to come to us with this open banking system, offering more things that are innovative and creative.",-1,0
"But like I said, if we don’t do it well, it could also mean that we could lose customers.",-1,0
"“I think it will be a limited open banking system here by the end of this year but eventually it will be totally open,” Lee says, adding that issues like legal structure, rights and data protection of customers are being worked out by the relevant authorities.",-1,0
"The third big trend that will be of significance is the sustainability agenda.",-1,0
"“Increasingly, a lot of investors are pressuring companies to be sustainable.",-1,0
"Obviously for banks, when they are asked to finance someone, they must make sure that it is done in a sustainable manner.",-1,0
"‘We have things like green bonds now – loans that are tied to meeting a certain sustainability agenda – you will see more of these happening,” he says.",-1,0
"IF anybody thought the worst was over for Bumi Armada after it sailed through a brutal downturn in the oil and gas industry three year ago, they were proven wrong last week.",-1,0
"An internal memo from executive director and group chief executive officer Leon Harland painted a sombre picture of the oil and gas company that is controlled by low-profile billionaire T. Ananda Krishnan.",-1,0
"Harkland told employees that the company had not made much progress with regard to improving its financials.",-1,0
"Cashflows are tight and it has limited its efforts to pursue new work.",-1,0
"He further stated that the financial situation has caused the group to be selective in pursuing new jobs and it hopes to complete its refinancing of a US$500mil facility by the first quarter of next year.",-1,0
"The message to employees supposedly triggered the stock to fall to an all-time low.",-1,0
"At 15.5 sen per share, Bumi Armada’s market capitalisation is only RM910mil.",-1,0
"Its value was RM13.5bil in May 2014, just before oil price started its slippery slope down from its high of US$120 per barrel.",-1,0
"Even at the nadir of oil price crisis when crude went below US$30 per barrel in early 2015, Bumi Armada fetched a valuation of almost RM5bil.",-1,0
"The value destruction is huge.",-1,0
"Ananda’s 34.9% stake is now worth only RM318mil, compared with more than RM1.75bil three years.",-1,0
"Investors such as the Employees Provident Fund, Permodalan Nasional Bhd and Kumpulan Wang Amanah Pencen are sitting on paper losses.",-1,0
"It is more painful for those who subscribed for Bumi Armada’s rights issue that was done at RM1.35 per share in October 2014.",-1,0
"The company raised RM1.9bil which was used mainly to expand its business.",-1,0
"In 2015 and 2016, Bumi Armada’s capital expenditure was high, which stretched it finances.",-1,0
"Bumi Armada recent fall started with the company making another heavy provision in its third quarter results released two weeks ago.",-1,0
"It made impairments to the tune of RM1.04bil, its second major provision in three years.",-1,0
"The provisions were for a floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel called Armada Kraken that was finally deployed to an oil and gas field in North Sea.",-1,0
"The other part of the provision came for its fleet of offshore support vessels.",-1,0
"A few days after the result was out, the internal memo was the talking point in the stock market.",-1,0
"Some view the memo as a warning shot to employees on the need for the company to take further measures to cut cost.",-1,0
"“I would not be surprised if the company embarks on a downsizing exercise.",-1,0
"It has happened before and right sizing technically should bring about better results on the longer term,” says an executive in the oil and gas industry.",-1,0
"However, there is also another view – which is more damaging to the stock price – that the company would not have the financial muscle to bid for new jobs.",-1,0
"Although Harland had said the company would not make a cash call from shareholders, investors are not convinced.",-1,0
"Bumi Armada has net liabilities of RM9.6bil as of Sept 30.",-1,0
"Interest servicing itself for the first nine months this year came up to RM390mil.",-1,0
"It has an order book of RM22.3bil and looking at RM12.5bil more in potential projects.",-1,0
"In the immediate term, it has US$500mil loan that has to be refinanced by the first quarter next year.",-1,0
"A successful refinancing should ease the repayment schedule of the company that has a gearing of two times.",-1,0
"Management has indicated to analysts that it was looking at several options to raise funds such as monetising some of its assets.",-1,0
"A cash call is the last resort.",-1,0
"Some research houses such as AmResearch and KAF highlight the “rising risk” of a capital raising through equities, especially if the group secures new jobs.",-1,0
"However, a fund manager says that it is highly unlikely for Bumi Armada to undertake a rights issue at current levels.",-1,0
"“It would not raise much money and gives rise to a huge dilution.",-1,0
"Why would shareholders, particularly Ananda agree to any fund raising through the issuance of shares?” says a fund manager.",-1,0
"Transition hit by stretched finances The year 2017 is a transition for Bumi Armada, a company that started off by mainly providing offshore marine services to oil and gas companies.",-1,0
"The transition is a switch in the company’s earnings dependency from the low-margin and highly-competitive offshore marine services to the more lucrative but capital intensive floating production services.",-1,0
"The offshore marine services are largely broken into the supply of offshore support vessels (OSV), which work on short contract tenures and vessels that undertakes sub-sea works, particularly pipe-laying and trenching activities.",-1,0
"Bumi Armada has 44 OSVs and three vessels for sub-sea activities.",-1,0
"Bumi Armada is among the top five companies in the provision of floating production vessels for offshore oil and gas works.",-1,0
"It has eight FPSOs and one vessel for storage and offloading of gas.",-1,0
"In 2013, before the collapse of oil prices and its strategy to grow its FPSO business, Bumi Armada was more dependent on the OSV market.",-1,0
"It had more than 50 OSVs and only four FPSOs.",-1,0
"Two out of the four FPSOs were operating in Nigeria where the cost of producing oil is high at about US$80 per barrel.",-1,0
"The two Nigerian FPSOs – Armada Perkasa and Armada Perdana – are no longer part of Bumi Armada’s operations following the collapse in oil prices.",-1,0
"Armada Perkasa was sold last year while operations on Armada Perdana is suspended because the charterer, Erin Energy Corp, which is an independent oil and gas company, could not pay on time.",-1,0
"In the latest development, the Nigerian arm of Erin Energy has been placed under receiver/manager.",-1,0
"Apart from Nigeria, Bumi Armada also ran into problems with a FPSO – Armada Claire – in Australia in 2016.",-1,0
"The client terminated the charter and the matter is now subject to arbitration.",-1,0
"In the meantime, Armada Claire is moored in Batam, Indonesia.",-1,0
"The volatile oil prices, which caused a reduction in the demand for OSVs and Bumi Armada’s aggressive move into the FPSO business that required high capital expenditure in 2015 and 2016, caused a strain in its financials in the last two years.",-1,0
"The utilisation of the OSV vessels was about 35% in the second quarter and improved to 44% in the third quarter of this year.",-1,0
"The charters on OSVs barely cover the cost of operations.",-1,0
"As for the FPSO business, the company delivered four vessels in 2017 and 2018 but saw its finances stretched.",-1,0
"Harland aptly sums up the company’s predicament in the 2017 annual report message to shareholders.",-1,0
"“It was challenging with substantially reduced activity in OSV, the termination of the Armada Claire FPSO charter, challenges with the Armada Perdana FPSO in Nigeria, plus ongoing construction of four FPO projects in the shipyards.",-1,0
"“As a result, we have been hit by reduced income whilst capital spending needed to continue at the same time and we have been relying on corporate debt facilities as result,” he had said.",-1,0
"On a brighter note, out of the eight FPSOs in Bumi Armada’s stable, six are mobilised and have started contributing to the company.",-1,0
"Contribution from the FPSO business is more than the OSV business for the nine months this year.",-1,0
"Catalyst and concerns Going forward, the catalyst for Bumi Armada is the outcome of its debt financing, monetisation of its assets such as the FPSO, the mobilisation of Armada Claire and its sub-sea vessels securing work in the Caspian Sea.",-1,0
"On debt financing, analyst are expecting the US$500mil unsecured loan to be refinanced considering the improved free cash-flow of the company, particularly from its FPSO business where six out of the eight vessels are in operations.",-1,0
"The two FPSOs deployed this year are Armada Kraken that is operating in North Sea and Armada Olombendo that is deployed to Angola.",-1,0
"For the first nine months of this year, net cash flow from operating activities improved to RM591.5mil compared with RM35.9mil last year.",-1,0
"“Of the US$500mil debt, the company has already repaid US$120mil and is negotiating with bankers to refinance the remainder.",-1,0
"It should not be a problem as long as cash flows improves,” said a fund manager.",-1,0
"AffinHwang, which has a price target of 55 sen for Bumi Armada, highlighted the improved cash-flow of Bumi Armada in a research note.",-1,0
"As for Armada Claire, it has been reported that the FPSO is the frontrunner to secure a charter for an oil and gas field in Brazil that has been awarded to a company from Australia.",-1,0
"The other bidders pulled out due to price concerns leaving Bumi Armada as the sole contender.",-1,0
"“Any news on the Armada Claire would only arrive towards the middle of next year provided oil prices remain at current levels,” says the fund manager.",-1,0
"Outside the FPSO business, Bumi Armada’s two vessels undertaking sub-sea activities in the Caspian Sea are expected to come under some scrutiny in the next two months.",-1,0
"According to UOB Kay Hian, the biggest risk to earnings at this juncture is the renewal of charter for Bumi Armada’s two vessels undertaking sub-sea works in Caspian Sea.",-1,0
"“We understand that both vessels are bidding for jobs in Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan with outcome to be known by end-2018.",-1,0
"Assuming this, activity may be high in second and third quarters of next year.",-1,0
"But it is not guaranteed that the vessels will earn revenues for all of 2019,” it said in a research report.",-1,0
"Most research houses have adopted a cautious stance on Bumi Armada even though it has a strong shareholder such as Ananda.",-1,0
"None of Ananda’s companies have gone under and oil and gas still holds a special place in his heart.",-1,0
"Hence the speculation of Ananda taking Bumi Armada private persists.",-1,0
"However, people close to the tycoon says that he is paying close attention to the developments in Bumi Armada and looking at the company and its position in the volatile oil and gas industry.",-1,0
"“The shareholders are getting anxious.",-1,0
"There may be some changes in the management if the company continues to spring negative surprises.",-1,0
