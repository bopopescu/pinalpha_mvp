"With the exception of the Valkyrie hypercar, the quartet of Aston Martin Vanquish Zagato models are some of the brand’s most talked-about vehicles in recent years.",-1,0
"Based around the Vanquish S, which has since been replaced by the DBS Superleggera, the Zagato models are mechanically identical to any Vanquish S you could buy new from the marque.",-1,0
"They do, however, look very different.",-1,0
"Most notably, all four have custom bodywork and share largely the same front and rear fascias, including the appealing taillights inspired by the track-only Vulcan.",-1,0
"The key points of difference between the models are the body styles.",-1,0
"The most traditional of the four is the Vanquish Zagato Coupe.",-1,0
"It has then been joined by the Volante, Speedster, and Shooting Brake.",-1,0
"Of the four, the Speedster is perhaps the most desirable, as is limited to just 28 units worldwide, whereas Aston Martin will build 99 units of the Coupe, Volante, and Shooting Brake.",-1,0
"Not everyone with a fat bank account can purchase a Vanquish Zagato as, due to their exclusivity, only owners of existing Aston Martins are eligible.",-1,0
"This makes the subject of the video below all the more interesting, as this collector was able to purchase all four Zagato models.",-1,0
"Making this collection even more special is the fact that each of the cars has been specced in exactly the same way, with a Lava Red paint adorned with various gold exterior accents.",-1,0
"The interior configurations are also the same and combine black and red leather.",-1,0
"Prepare for an example of the lifestyle of the rich and famous.",-1,0
"One individual decided not to purchase just one of the four Aston Martin Vanquish Zagato body styles, but all four.",-1,0
"The British firm introduced the Vanquish Zagato back in 2016, originally as a coupe.",-1,0
"A convertible soon followed and then Aston Martin added speedster and shooting brake body styles.",-1,0
"The brand debuted all four as somewhat of a going away present for the second-generation Vanquish, as the 2019 DBS Superleggera took over flagship GT duties.",-1,0
"We don't actually know much about the man who purchased all four cars, but his friendand the video's hostshowcased all four of the cars in matching Lava Red exterior colors.",-1,0
"And they all look just as good as they did when the first of them debuted almost three years ago.",-1,0
"Aston Martin Vanquish Zagato Speedster
The Zagato coupe, convertible, and shooting brake are limited to 99 units each.",-1,0
"The speedster, on the other hand, is limited to just 28 cars.",-1,0
"That makes the host's friend one well-positioned buyer to take delivery of all four cars.",-1,0
"Each car is built to the same specification as the Vanquish S, which means a 5.9-liter V-12 sits under the hood of all four cars and makes 580 horsepower.",-1,0
"Said power heads to the rear wheels exclusively.",-1,0
"The production of the cars features plenty of carbon fiber and Zagato ensured the conceptual "bladed" taillights made their way to production.",-1,0
"Although the speedster is the most limited, the shooting brake is truly the most interesting.",-1,0
"It's a two-seater with Zagato's signature double-bubble design and glass inlays that stretch across the roof for plenty of natural light.",-1,0
"Though, all four cars are lovely looking in their own way.",-1,0
"As for how much this Aston enthusiast spent on his purchase, we don't know.",-1,0
"Last we heard, a Zagato shooting brake cost around $500,000 alone.",-1,0
"And we doubt the British firm gave him a package deal for all four cars.",-1,0
"Cancelled trains, lengthy delays, cracked bridges and wildcat strikes by disgruntled employees a trail of chaos in recent months has caused Deutsche Bahn (DB) to become the butt of jokes and withering complaints.",-1,0

"Next month railway chiefs will have to present a rescue plan to government.",-1,0
"But even then industry observers are pessimistic.",-1,0
"The danger is that the condition of the railway has reached the point where it is going to continue going downhill despite increased government investment, Kay Scheller, president of the national audit office said earlier this month, citing a chronic investment bottleneck.",-1,0
"Germanys Pro Rail Alliance, an amalgamation of non-profit NGOs and businesses, says 90% of Germans support its call for more investment.",-1,0
"It argues that despite a big financial injection in recent years, Germanys 69 per capita spending in rail infrastructure still lags far behind that of comparable countries such as Britain (165) and Switzerland (362).",-1,0
"Theres just not enough money, and necessary investment decisions have been put off, said Karl-Peter Naumann of the passenger lobby group Pro Bahn.",-1,0
"The embarrassment is rising along with the commuters pain.",-1,0

That is an exaggeration, of course.",-1,0
"But it reflects the extent to which commuters are smarting.",-1,0
"The paper cited some regular examples of excuses for chaos on the railways, including frozen tracks, branches on the line, and under- or overheated carriages.",-1,0
"To the [neighbouring] Swiss, who are annoyed by German unpunctuality because it messes up their own train timetable, we are becoming a joke, the paper added.",-1,0
"In its effort to persuade more customers to take the train, DB has run a number of campaigns in recent years offering everything from free massages to free child care.",-1,0
"When delays started becoming the norm, it experimented with pumping calming scents through the air conditioning to reduce the risk of rail rage.",-1,0

"Industry observers say one of the main problems is that for years the transportation of German passengers has only made up about 30% of DBs main business.",-1,0
"Its transport logistics arm, DB Schenker which has businesses as far afield as South Africa, Australia and China, and is the biggest freight operator in the UK is far bigger.",-1,0
"DB Schenker was built up in order to make DB attractive for investors ahead of privatisation plans around the turn of the century, which were then shelved in 2014.",-1,0
"Vehement political opposition to the deal focused in part on the state of the privatised railway network in the UK.",-1,0
"Transport economists have advised DB to sell off DB Schenker, as well as Arriva, the British operator of buses and regional trains, which it also owns.",-1,0

"While investors in North America and Europe have been selling off bank stocks to a degree that seems to price in a coming recession, Singapores banks have held up a little better.",-1,0
"I was a little concerned about China-related macro risk and efforts to slow/cool Singapores housing market in reference to DBS Group (OTCPK:DBSDY) back in August, but the shares have done okay next to most global indices as housing, construction, and manufacturing-related demand have all held up reasonably well.",-1,0
"I continue to believe that DBS Group shares look appealing barring a global recession and/or a serious deterioration in China.",-1,0
"Loan demand is likely to slow noticeably next year, but DBS Group should still be poised to benefit from some rate moves while credit quality remains benign.",-1,0
"Longer term, I expect meaningful leverage from the companys investments in digitalization and market entry/development in India and Indonesia.",-1,0
"DBS, China, and The U.S. Sound And Fury, But How Much Significance?",-1,0
"DBS management has gone to some lengths to reassure investors about the banks exposure to weaker loan demand in China due to tensions between China and the U.S..",-1,0
"I believe DBS management is right to note that near-term supply chain changes have been minimal, reminding me of a quote I saw recently in regards to the tariffs and American manufacturers that at 10% tariffs you just try to pass along the costs, at 25% you start making changes To that end, the agreement earlier this month between the U.S. and China to pause further tariff hikes is a welcome development.",-1,0
"I wouldnt say that DBS is completely in the clear.",-1,0
"Loan growth denominated in HKD and RMB declined from 21% and 28% in the second quarter to 12% and 18%, respectively, in the third quarter, with sequential declines in both categories.",-1,0
"Trade financing seems to be the primary driver here, and DBS Group doesnt have all that much exposure to the declines in capex spending being reported by Japanese automation and machinery companies in reference to Chinese manufacturers.",-1,0
"DBS does have leverage to slowing economic activity, slowing construction, and an overall trend toward deleveraging, so I wouldnt say the situation in China is perfectly fine either.",-1,0
"Between DBS and its Singaporean peers OCBC (OTCPK:OVCHF) and UOB (OTCPK:UOVEF), I like DBSs relative positioning China.",-1,0
"Although DBS has the most profit exposure to Hong Kong and Greater China of the group, UOBs exposure is more concentrated towards banks and OCBC is more exposed to property; DBSs exposure to trade financing isnt bulletproof, but the NPLs are low and the short-term nature of these loans limits credit risk to some extent.",-1,0
"Some Near-Term Challenges In Singapore, But Longer-Term Opportunities In Asia
Since the Singaporean government decided to cool down the residential property market, DBS Group has seen a 50% decline in new mortgage originations.",-1,0
"Now, Singapores residential market isnt as significant to DBS Group as it is to OCBC or UOB, but it still matters and the banks overall housing loan balance increased less than 1% sequentially in the third quarter.",-1,0
"The remainder of Singapores economy is healthy, though, and business demand for loans remains solid, with DBS Group reporting more than 5% yoy and 1% qoq growth in Singapore dollar-denominated loans.",-1,0
"I dont see all that much room for major share gains for DBS in Singapore and I expect relatively modest future growth for the city-state in the low single-digits.",-1,0
"It should remain a profitable and attractive market for DBS, particularly as the bank leverages ongoing investments in digitalization to reduce costs, but it wont be a major growth driver.",-1,0
"I do believe that the investments the company is making today to expand into markets like India and Indonesia will deliver more meaningful growth in the years to come.",-1,0
"Although India and Indonesia both have relatively high levels of banking penetration in terms of the percentage of the population with bank accounts, actual participation seems to be significantly lower than the penetration numbers (around 80% for India, over 50% for Indonesia) would otherwise suggest.",-1,0
"With banking services still widely underutilized in growing economies, I see significant opportunities for DBS Group, particularly as it gets to start with a clean slate and can build its business with a strong focus on digital and mobile offerings from day one.",-1,0
"Longer term, I would also expect to see DBS Group target the Vietnamese banking market.",-1,0
"I dont see particularly compelling opportunities for DBS in Malaysia or Thailand, but Vietnam could be an attractive opportunity, though it will take a long time to develop.",-1,0
"The Outlook 
Barring a global economic meltdown (or just a China-centered meltdown), I think DBSs target of 5% to 6% loan growth in 2019 is credible, and the bank should benefit from loan repricings throughout 2019, as the vast majority of its SGD-denominated loans are floating rate.",-1,0
"Id also note that DBS is still seeing positive rate leverage, though the 4bp spread between the qoq increase in loan yields and cost of funds is a little narrower than Id like.",-1,0
"Managing expenses is going to be important for DBS in the next few years.",-1,0
"Although I think most investors are comfortable with the spending money today to make and save money later tradeoff with IT investments, spending was higher than expected in the third quarter and management needs to be careful with their guidance and execution here.",-1,0
"As far as the companys long-held target of 13% ROE, I believe theres a good chance of hitting that level (a record level) in 2020.",-1,0
"Ive trimmed back my near-term expectations for the next few years, but the revisions are modest (2% to 3%), and I still believe DBS can generate long-term core earnings growth in the high single-digits while still paying an attractive dividend.",-1,0
"The Bottom Line
Discounting my estimated long-term core earnings and running DBSs near-term ROTE through my ROTE-P/TBV model both give me fair value estimates of around $90 ($89 to $92 more specifically).",-1,0
"That suggests meaningful upside from here, and while I dont dismiss the risks of further economic weakness in China and follow-on effects elsewhere in Singapores operating area, I think the risk/reward balance is still attractively priced for more risk-tolerant and patient investors.",-1,0

"That’s because the OnePlus 7 is expected to be a much more significant upgrade compared to the 6T, which however great it is (and it is great) was more of an incremental boost over the still excellent OnePlus 6.",-1,0

"Related: Best Android phones
As you can see, the key design tweak the OnePlus 7 could feature is a sliding display mechanism, which would hide the device’s front camera when not in use, effectively ridding the phone of an unsightly ‘notch’ cut-out and making for a true all-screen experience with virtually no bezels.",-1,0
"While speculative at this stage, such a move is perfectly plausible.",-1,0
"OnePlus handsets are often partly inspired by the flagship efforts of parent firm Oppo, whose recent Oppo Find X smartphone sported such a design.",-1,0
"Elsewhere, you’ll notice a triple camera system on the rear of the device.",-1,0
"This is set to be one of the biggest flagship trends of 2019, after it debuted to great effect on handsets like the Huawei P20 Pro earlier this year, and we wouldn’t be at all surprised if started to filter down to more affordable handsets like the OnePlus 7, which should cost a fraction of the price of more established 2019 flagships like the Galaxy S10.",-1,0

BY MIKE LUCASUWBadgers.com Senior Writer
MADISON, Wis. Jim Leonhard knew all along what he had.",-1,0
"But the 36-year-old Wisconsin defensive coordinator admitted, "I don't know if the rest of the Badgers fans knew how special that group was a year ago.",-1,0
"That's not normal to have that level of experience and playmaking on your defense."",-1,0
"Going into their 2017 Orange Bowl matchup with Miami, the Badgers ranked No.",-1,0
"1 nationally in total defense (253.2) and passing efficiency defense (96.3), and No.",-1,0
"2 in scoring defense (13.2) and rushing defense (92.6).",-1,0
"They had allowed eight touchdowns over the previous eight games.",-1,0
"Leonhard opened with a nickel package against the Canes, including four fifth-year seniors (Alec James, Conor Sheehy, Garret Dooley, Leon Jacobs), a four-year starter (Derrick Tindal), a speedy jack-of-all trades (Natrell Jamerson) and a junior (Nick Nelson) who went on to be drafted in the fourth round.",-1,0
"The leading tacklers were the inside linebackers, Ryan Connelly and T.J. Edwards, a first-team All-American and Butkus Award runner-up.",-1,0
"The quarterback/catalyst in the secondary was D'Cota Dixon, the fourth-leading tackler.",-1,0
"The nickel back was Dontye Carriere-Williams, a redshirt freshman.",-1,0
"Off that starting unit which had a hand in Wisconsin's 34-24 win over the Hurricanes on their home turf at Hard Rock Stadium Edwards and Dixon will be the only returning defensive starters for the Dec. 27 rematch in the New Era Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium.",-1,0
""Obviously, we knew coming into this year, it was going to be a different group and guys were going to have to step into bigger roles," Leonhard said of the expected personnel losses.",-1,0
""They were going to be asked to do different things and more than they have in the past."",-1,0
"Besides Edwards and Dixon, outside linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel, defensive end Isaiahh Loudermilk, and cornerback Madison Cone are the only other active Badgers to show up in the defensive stats (excluding special teams) from the Orange Bowl.",-1,0
"That is a dramatic turnover.",-1,0
""It has been a challenge, at times," acknowledged Leonhard, who's completing his third season on the UW staff, second as the DC.",-1,0
""But I love the way our guys work they battle and they're not looking for sympathy.",-1,0
"All they're trying to do is get better and help this team win games."",-1,0
"Injuries took a toll.",-1,0
"Defensive end Garrett Rand, a projected starter, was lost over the summer with an Achilles injury.",-1,0
"He had two tackles against the Canes.",-1,0
""You take him out of the lineup for the entire season," Leonhard said, "and everyone is in a different role than they would have been."",-1,0
"Coupled with Rand's loss was Loudermilk's rehab from offseason surgery which kept him on the sideline during training camp.",-1,0
"Along with replacing the seniors (James, Sheehy, Chikwe Obasih), Leonhard had to patch together a defensive line for the opener without Rand and Loudermilk.",-1,0
"The anchor was nose tackle Olive Sagapolu, a 19-game starter.",-1,0
"On the first defensive possession of the season against Western Kentucky, Sagapolu lined up with a couple of redshirt freshmen: Matt Henningsen and Kayden Lyles, a converted offensive guard.",-1,0
"Lyles will go back to offense next season.",-1,0
""He was filling a hole we needed him to fill," Leonhard said.",-1,0
""It was very unselfish on his part."",-1,0
"In late October, the Badgers had another hole on their defensive front, a huge hole, when Sagapolu injured his arm at Northwestern and was lost for the remainder of the season.",-1,0
"A young D-line got even younger when Bryson Williams, a true freshman, made his first start against Rutgers.",-1,0
"The front seven was rarely at full strength.",-1,0
"Loudermilk returned for BYU (Sept. 15) and made three starts before going down with a high-ankle sprain; the same injury that Van Ginkel sustained against BYU.",-1,0
"He continued to play but at a limited capacity.",-1,0
"Last week, it was announced that Connelly, UW's second-leading tackler, would miss the Pinstripe Bowl and have surgery for an injury that hampered him over the final month of the regular season, according to head coach Paul Chryst.",-1,0
"Connelly is a fifth-year senior.",-1,0
""I couldn't be more proud as a coach of the impact that he's had on this team.",-1,0
"He does everything you ask of him the way you want him to do it," Leonhard said.",-1,0
""We have to get guys to rally around him; this is not the way he wanted to go out and finish this thing.",-1,0
""Between Chris and Jack, they're going to have to step up and man that position."",-1,0
"Chris is redshirt junior Chris Orr, a veteran of 35 games and 15 starts.",-1,0
"Jack is true freshman Jack Sanborn, who has appeared in 10 games.",-1,0
"This season, the Edwards and Connelly tag team flourished despite all the youngsters around them despite the expectations for one or the other, or both, to be the defensive leader regardless of the circumstances.",-1,0
"Through 12 games, they have combined for 193 tackles, 20.5 tackles for loss and six sacks.",-1,0
""The tough thing for me was trying to find guys outside of T.J. and Ryan to make plays, big plays," said Leonhard, pointing out that Van Ginkel and Dixon were "beat up throughout the year and there were few games where I would say they were truly themselves."",-1,0
"Leonhard has been waiting on the development of that "next wave" of contributors.",-1,0
""Zack Baun did it at times; he was very dynamic for us," he said of Wisconsin's third-leading tackler who had 60 stops, 29 fewer than Connelly.",-1,0
""But you look outside of that group (of linebackers), it was pretty inconsistent as far as game-changing plays, just noticeable big plays."",-1,0
"Last year, the Badgers had 89 TFLs, 42 sacks and 20 interceptions, including three against Miami in the Orange Bowl.",-1,0
"They also returned five picks for touchdowns, a school record; and had a fumble return for a score.",-1,0
"By comparison, they've had 57 TFLs, 18 sacks and 10 interceptions in 2018.",-1,0
""Not that guys weren't doing really good things," said Leonhard, "but as a secondary, especially, we struggled making quarterbacks pay.",-1,0
"The more aggressive teams are, if you don't take the ball away, you're going to be in trouble eventually.",-1,0
""I was pleased with how our guys grew and I was happy with the way that they worked.",-1,0
"We're a lot farther along right now than we were at the beginning of the season."",-1,0
"In the past, the Badgers have been able to reload on defense.",-1,0
"When they lost T.J. Watt and Vince Biegel, they had Dooley and Jacobs step up.",-1,0
"Both were seasoned vets.",-1,0
"When they lost Sojourn Shelton at corner, they had Nelson; when they lost Leo Musso at safety, they had Jamerson.",-1,0
"By contrast, a true freshman took over for Nelson this season; a redshirt freshman for Jamerson.",-1,0
""It's one of those things where you have to play longer together to get a feel for each other," Edwards said.",-1,0
""Towards the end of the year, we were closer to that."",-1,0
"Defensively, the Badgers were in rebuild mode, especially the secondary.",-1,0
"At Michigan, for instance, youth was served.",-1,0
"Out of necessity.",-1,0
"Rachad Wildgoose started at corner and Reggie Pearson at safety.",-1,0
"Both are true freshmen.",-1,0
"Eric Burrell, a sophomore, replaced an injured Dixon at the other safety.",-1,0
"And Deron Harrell, a redshirt freshman, was the other corner.",-1,0
"The week before Michigan, the starters were Dixon, Harrell, redshirt freshman Scott Nelson and redshirt freshman Faion Hicks.",-1,0
"The week after Michigan, the starters in the nickel package were Harrell, Burrell, Wildgoose, sophomore Madison Cone and fifth-year senior Evan Bondoc.",-1,0
"Another sophomore, Caesar Williams, and another true freshman, Donte Burton, also made starts in the back end.",-1,0
""It was very challenging because you don't really get a lot of cohesion as a group," Leonhard confirmed.",-1,0
""It was rarely the same guys performing at that level, week-in and week-out, whether it was due to injuries or just youth and inexperience.",-1,0
""Eventually, it's going to pay off."",-1,0
"Leonhard tailored his lesson plans to his students.",-1,0
""Knowing you don't have the experience, you really have to teach football," he said.",-1,0
""You have to teach basics and maybe keep it a little simpler at times to just give guys the opportunity to play fast.",-1,0
""You have to help them play confident you have to help them play physical."",-1,0
"Leonhard's coaching and teaching adjustments have not gone unnoticed.",-1,0
""I just felt like he did a really good job of keeping us more accountable," Dixon said.",-1,0
""From 2016 (Leonhard's first year), he has taken the initiative of understanding each player for who they are and then implementing tools or techniques.",-1,0
"When you've got younger dudes, you've got to adapt to them."",-1,0
"Leonhard's flexibility stood out to Edwards.",-1,0
""He changed his style to accommodate what we have this year," he said.",-1,0
""I love it.",-1,0
"That's exactly what a coach should do."",-1,0
"The future looks promising.",-1,0
"Nine underclassmen started at least once in the secondary: Hicks (10), Wildgoose (7), Nelson (7), Burrell (5), Harrell (5), Williams (4), Cone (2), Pearson (1) and Burton (1).",-1,0
"True freshmen Travian Blaylock and Alexander Smith also saw some action but, like Burton and Pearson, preserved their redshirts by playing in four or fewer games.",-1,0
""With our injury situation this year, we were able to get guys some good quality reps who are going to still redshirt.",-1,0
"I like the rule," Leonhard said.",-1,0
""It's still going to be a work in progress as far as what's best for everyone.",-1,0
"But I definitely think it helped us out."",-1,0
"Collin Wilder, a University of Houston transfer, is another player that Leonhard is excited about.",-1,0
"He appeared in 13 games as a true freshman at UH but only two as a sophomore after injuring his knee.",-1,0
""You can ask anyone in the locker room," Leonhard said, "and he has showed up in big ways."",-1,0
"At various points, so did many of his young pups on defense.",-1,0
"The Badgers blanked Iowa in the fourth quarter of a 28-17 road win.",-1,0
"They held Michigan's Shea Patterson to 124 passing yards.",-1,0
"They intercepted Northwestern's Clayton Thorson three times.",-1,0
"They held Purdue to a fourth-quarter field goal in another come-from-behind win (47-44 in triple overtime).",-1,0
"As for the inevitable growing pains, Dixon said, "We definitely matured since week one.",-1,0
"I think it's going to pay dividends in the long run.",-1,0
"There was a big learning curve.",-1,0
"But guys crossed over the hump.",-1,0
"Now, it's time to take the next step."",-1,0
"Van Ginkel can relate to what many of the DBs have been going through.",-1,0
"As a redshirt freshman, he started 11 games at South Dakota (where he was first-team All-Missouri Valley).",-1,0
""You're trying to make sure you're lined up correctly let alone being in the right spot to make the play," he said.",-1,0
"But he has seen progress and growth on defense even with the Minnesota setback.",-1,0
""You've seen a lot of people step up into the spot where we needed them and really embrace their role," said Van Ginkel, a senior.",-1,0
""Obviously, our secondary and D-line has been thin with all the injuries and things going on.",-1,0
"But they got experience throughout the year.",-1,0
""I'm not worried about the young guys at all.",-1,0
"You're starting to see a lot more of them like Matt Henningsen, Faion Hicks and Rachad Wildgoose make plays in key moments.",-1,0
"And they'll just continue to grow.",-1,0
"I'm excited for what their future holds."",-1,0
