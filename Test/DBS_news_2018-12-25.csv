"Before I begin, a very merry Christmas and happy holiday season to the readers of Cheesehead TV!",-1,0
"Thank you for having made this first year as a contributor to the site a whole lot of fun for me.",-1,0
"I came aboard in January after the close of the 2017 season, and while this hasnt been the season wed hoped for all summer, its certainly been a lot of fun to be a part of the season-long journey here at CHTV.",-1,0
"----
It was a rough start to the football game in Week 16 for Aaron Rodgers, as he missed a wide open Davante Adams twice in two throws on the opening drive.",-1,0
"I was certainly among the many frustrated individuals who foresaw yet another frustrating game of Rodgers accuracy having inexplicably evaporated, but it turned out that the quarterback (and the team as a whole) got past a rough first quarter and showed a lot of fight in what may be a meaningless game for the Packers season prospects, but was the kind of game that displayed a mentality that can hopefully carry over into 2019.",-1,0
"Theres been a lot of debate as to whether the Packers should shut down Rodgers for the season or not, and I understand both perspectives.",-1,0
"Personally I tend to fall on the side that you treat your players equally and that you pay the man the richest contract in NFL history to play and win football games, but I do see the merits in trying to protect your investment.",-1,0
"[With regard to that debate, I couldnt really care less about improving draft stockdifference makers are found at all points in the first round every single year in the draft.",-1,0
"Its about drafting well, not about drafting high.]",-1,0
"The debate is surely going to rage on into Week 17, even though Rodgers will undoubtedly play.",-1,0
"But display of leadership Rodgers showed in his performance was inspiring.",-1,0
"It has not been a good season at all by Rodgers standards, and I have been a critic of his over the last several weeks in particular, but the fact that he was willing to come out to the field and fight for his teammates (literally in some cases) was an excellent display of leadership by example.",-1,0
"Plus, his words at the end of the game shed some light on his mindset, the kind of philosophy you want out of any leader on your team.",-1,0
"I love competing in anything.",-1,0
"I dont want to look back in 20 years and wonder, What if I had played that game?",-1,0
"Could something special have happened?",-1,0
"What would it look like to my teammates if they knew I kind of quit on them?",-1,0
"I hope my teammates know Im never going to quit on them.",-1,0
"Our Game-Changing Play of the Week could have been a number of different plays that occurred late in the fourth quarter and overtime, but I decided to select a play that displayed Rodgers mettle and leadership.",-1,0
"The Context
At this point in the game, the Packers were in need of a touchdown for a go-ahead score in the waning moments of the fourth quarter.",-1,0
"Aaron Rodgers did what hes done many times throughout his careerdrive the offense down the field to get a go-ahead score.",-1,0
"The defense then promptly did what its also done many times throughout Rodgers career, and give up the lead earned late by Rodgers and the offense, but at least the team had the opportunity to win in overtime.",-1,0
"The end of this drive saw Rodgers take matters into his own hands, jumping over the pile at the goal line and just barely extending the ball to the point needed to score.",-1,0
"But on the way, Rodgers took out a big chunk of yardage with a 23-yard scamper that showcased the desire he had to win this ballgame.",-1,0
"Lets take a look.",-1,0
"The Play
The Packers line up in shotgun with Jamaal Williams in the backfield.",-1,0
"Davante Adams is alone down to the right, while Jimmy Graham is playing upright to the left, with Marquez Valdez-Scantling in the slot and Jake Kumerow split out wide left.",-1,0
"Adams and Kumerow are both running deep routes down the sideline to the endzone, while Graham runs an out and up in the middle and MVS runs a hook to find a zone underneath.",-1,0
"Williams stays in to block.",-1,0
"You can already see Rodgers looking Kumerows way.",-1,0
"He never actually looks right here, and youll see why momentarily.",-1,0
"Williams does an excellent job at picking up the blitz, giving Rodgers the time he needs to survey the field and determine his best optionpass or run.",-1,0
"Rodgers has time to throw it here, and could try to get the ball off to MVS, whos found an opening in the defense.",-1,0
"But what he also sees is that with the blitzing linebacker vacating the shallow middle of the field and with Graham drawing a defender downfield with him on the out and up, suddenly theres a whole lot of room on the whole left side of the field to run, and his offensive line and Williams have him covered.",-1,0
"The decision to run is solidified when he sees Jets CB #43 Parry Nickerson (circled) following MVS back to the middle of the field.",-1,0
"Rodgers is already running left, meaning if he takes off right now hes got Nickerson going the opposite way.",-1,0
"The time itll take Nickerson to stop and turn around wont give him a shot at getting Rodgers before he gets to the first down marker, and theres plenty more field to work with after that.",-1,0
"Nickerson sees that Rodgers has taken off and is able to turn back around, but hes already in a tough spot here, as hes basically backing up while running.",-1,0
"Rodgers motions for MVS to block for him, and MVS has all the leverage here.",-1,0
"Hes able to push Nickerson back all the way into the endzone, a good 15 yards.",-1,0
"At that point, the only people who have a shot at stopping Rodgers are the DBs down the field covering Kumerow and Graham.",-1,0
"MVS still pushing Nickerson back to the endzone.",-1,0
"Makes it easy on the receiver when the QB is able to get the guy off balance.",-1,0
"Rodgers isnt done yet, and very symbolically, hes not going down without a fight.",-1,0
"He lowers his shoulder to pick up as much yardage as he can, and gets the ball down to just about the two yard line.",-1,0
"This play emphasized the type of gusto and panache the Packers have been lacking much of the year, and it was heartening to see the team come out and battle when they could have easily just thrown in the towel and tanked (as an alarmingly large portion of the fanbase seems to want them to do).",-1,0
"It wasnt always pretty yesterday, but as a fan, it was fun to watch a victory and to see Rodgers come out feeling like he had something to prove even in a meaningless football game.",-1,0
"One more game this season, and I hope this mentality spills over into next week and beyond.",-1,0
