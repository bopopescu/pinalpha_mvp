"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The dollar steadied in Asian trade on Thursday after the Federal Reserve stepped back from a more aggressive policy tightening path even as it gave markets the distinct impression of being much less cautious than they had anticipated.",-1,0
"In a widely expected decision, the U.S. central bank hiked interest rates by 25 basis points, its fourth increase this year, while forecasting fewer rate increases in 2019 than it had at its September policy meeting.",-1,0
"Yet markets were surprised by the Fed’s commitment to retain the core of its plan to tighten monetary policy, despite rising uncertainty about global economic growth, sending Wall Street stocks tumbling and depressing Asian equities.",-1,0
"“Investors had braced for the worst - from no rate hike to dissents and a change in the risk assessment,” said Kathy Lien, managing director of currency strategy at BK Asset Management.",-1,0
"“And while there were subtle tweaks in the statement and lowered growth and inflation forecast, these changes were not as significant as the market had hoped.” 
Indeed, while the Fed’s ‘dot plots’ now signal two, instead of three, rate hikes for next year, the market remains unconvinced and is barely pricing one increase in a reflection of the slowdown in global growth.",-1,0
"The dollar index was steady at 96.99 at 0402 GMT, managing to recover from an overnight low of 96.55 and the New York close of 96.97 as markets came to terms with the Fed’s outlook.",-1,0
"In a press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell suggested that the expected two hikes for 2019 weren’t set in tone.",-1,0

"Selena Ling, head of treasury research at OCBC bank, said economic data will determine what the Fed eventually does next year.",-1,0
"“We shade our forecast to two rather than three FOMC hikes next year, but emphasise that we’re essentially back to data dependency i.e.",-1,0

"While investors in North America and Europe have been selling off bank stocks to a degree that seems to price in a coming recession, Singapores banks have held up a little better.",-1,0
"I was a little concerned about China-related macro risk and efforts to slow/cool Singapores housing market in reference to DBS Group (OTCPK:DBSDY) back in August, but the shares have done okay next to most global indices as housing, construction, and manufacturing-related demand have all held up reasonably well.",-1,0
"I continue to believe that DBS Group shares look appealing barring a global recession and/or a serious deterioration in China.",-1,0
"Loan demand is likely to slow noticeably next year, but DBS Group should still be poised to benefit from some rate moves while credit quality remains benign.",-1,0
"Longer term, I expect meaningful leverage from the companys investments in digitalization and market entry/development in India and Indonesia.",-1,0
"DBS, China, and The U.S. Sound And Fury, But How Much Significance?",-1,0
"DBS management has gone to some lengths to reassure investors about the banks exposure to weaker loan demand in China due to tensions between China and the U.S..",-1,0
"I believe DBS management is right to note that near-term supply chain changes have been minimal, reminding me of a quote I saw recently in regards to the tariffs and American manufacturers that at 10% tariffs you just try to pass along the costs, at 25% you start making changes To that end, the agreement earlier this month between the U.S. and China to pause further tariff hikes is a welcome development.",-1,0
"I wouldnt say that DBS is completely in the clear.",-1,0
"Loan growth denominated in HKD and RMB declined from 21% and 28% in the second quarter to 12% and 18%, respectively, in the third quarter, with sequential declines in both categories.",-1,0
"Trade financing seems to be the primary driver here, and DBS Group doesnt have all that much exposure to the declines in capex spending being reported by Japanese automation and machinery companies in reference to Chinese manufacturers.",-1,0
"DBS does have leverage to slowing economic activity, slowing construction, and an overall trend toward deleveraging, so I wouldnt say the situation in China is perfectly fine either.",-1,0
"Between DBS and its Singaporean peers OCBC (OTCPK:OVCHF) and UOB (OTCPK:UOVEF), I like DBSs relative positioning China.",-1,0
"Although DBS has the most profit exposure to Hong Kong and Greater China of the group, UOBs exposure is more concentrated towards banks and OCBC is more exposed to property; DBSs exposure to trade financing isnt bulletproof, but the NPLs are low and the short-term nature of these loans limits credit risk to some extent.",-1,0
"Some Near-Term Challenges In Singapore, But Longer-Term Opportunities In Asia
Since the Singaporean government decided to cool down the residential property market, DBS Group has seen a 50% decline in new mortgage originations.",-1,0
"Now, Singapores residential market isnt as significant to DBS Group as it is to OCBC or UOB, but it still matters and the banks overall housing loan balance increased less than 1% sequentially in the third quarter.",-1,0
"The remainder of Singapores economy is healthy, though, and business demand for loans remains solid, with DBS Group reporting more than 5% yoy and 1% qoq growth in Singapore dollar-denominated loans.",-1,0
"I dont see all that much room for major share gains for DBS in Singapore and I expect relatively modest future growth for the city-state in the low single-digits.",-1,0
"It should remain a profitable and attractive market for DBS, particularly as the bank leverages ongoing investments in digitalization to reduce costs, but it wont be a major growth driver.",-1,0
"I do believe that the investments the company is making today to expand into markets like India and Indonesia will deliver more meaningful growth in the years to come.",-1,0
"Although India and Indonesia both have relatively high levels of banking penetration in terms of the percentage of the population with bank accounts, actual participation seems to be significantly lower than the penetration numbers (around 80% for India, over 50% for Indonesia) would otherwise suggest.",-1,0
"With banking services still widely underutilized in growing economies, I see significant opportunities for DBS Group, particularly as it gets to start with a clean slate and can build its business with a strong focus on digital and mobile offerings from day one.",-1,0
"Longer term, I would also expect to see DBS Group target the Vietnamese banking market.",-1,0
"I dont see particularly compelling opportunities for DBS in Malaysia or Thailand, but Vietnam could be an attractive opportunity, though it will take a long time to develop.",-1,0
"The Outlook 
Barring a global economic meltdown (or just a China-centered meltdown), I think DBSs target of 5% to 6% loan growth in 2019 is credible, and the bank should benefit from loan repricings throughout 2019, as the vast majority of its SGD-denominated loans are floating rate.",-1,0
"Id also note that DBS is still seeing positive rate leverage, though the 4bp spread between the qoq increase in loan yields and cost of funds is a little narrower than Id like.",-1,0
"Managing expenses is going to be important for DBS in the next few years.",-1,0
"Although I think most investors are comfortable with the spending money today to make and save money later tradeoff with IT investments, spending was higher than expected in the third quarter and management needs to be careful with their guidance and execution here.",-1,0
"As far as the companys long-held target of 13% ROE, I believe theres a good chance of hitting that level (a record level) in 2020.",-1,0
"Ive trimmed back my near-term expectations for the next few years, but the revisions are modest (2% to 3%), and I still believe DBS can generate long-term core earnings growth in the high single-digits while still paying an attractive dividend.",-1,0
"The Bottom Line
Discounting my estimated long-term core earnings and running DBSs near-term ROTE through my ROTE-P/TBV model both give me fair value estimates of around $90 ($89 to $92 more specifically).",-1,0
"That suggests meaningful upside from here, and while I dont dismiss the risks of further economic weakness in China and follow-on effects elsewhere in Singapores operating area, I think the risk/reward balance is still attractively priced for more risk-tolerant and patient investors.",-1,0
