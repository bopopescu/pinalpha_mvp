"In fact, there is a way that is not only safer, but also cheaper and better for the environment: hydroponic farming.",-1,0
"Having become quite popular in the last few years, hydroponic farming is quite easy for consumers to replicate at the comfort of their homes because it only requires water.",-1,0
"Without the need for soil, hydroponic farming eliminates the concerns for pests or messiness.",-1,0

"Hydroponic farming equipments are relatively cheap to acquire, or even to build.",-1,0
"A simple search for "hydroponic kits" on Lazada shows a variety of options that range from S$60 to S$160, depending on the size and functionality of the kit.",-1,0

"for much less.",-1,0

"Not only that, since it doesn't require using fertilizers or pesticides, it tends to be much safer for the environment.",-1,0

"If you are interested in trying farming at your flat, leafy greens like lettuce, kale, spinach and small but "water friendly" root plants like radishes, onions, carrots and strawberries are the easiest to grow in a hydroponic garden.",-1,0
