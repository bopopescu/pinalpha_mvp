""And they're very similar to a lot of teams that we play in our division."",-1,0
"Defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul leads the team with 11.5 sacks, followed by defensive end Carl Nassib with 6.5 and defensive tackle Gerald McCoy with 6.",-1,0

"Evans also has 24 receptions of 20-or-more yards, second only to Kansas City's Tyreek Hill.",-1,0
"On the other hand, there should be opportunities for the Dallas secondary to make plays against a Bucs offense that leads the NFL with 25 interceptions, five more than any other team.",-1,0
""Evans, he's elite now," Cowboys defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli said.",-1,0
""Somehow, when he starts scrambling, he finds No.",-1,0

"This may feel like an inopportune time of year to discuss such matters, but there really is no good time.",-1,0
"So on the eve of Christmas, and fairly close to the eve of the College Football Playoff and a Cotton Bowl matchup against Clemson, Notre Dame cornerback Love is going to teach us how to break up.",-1,0

"It was just nerves that made me do that early on.",-1,0
"*Want an easy recipe for going 48?",-1,0
"Find yourself in a spot that requires that many young contributors in the defensive backfield.",-1,0
"Though born of fear, that habit taught Love a few things.",-1,0
"First, college quarterbacks might tell you where theyre throwing before the ball is even snapped.",-1,0
"Love noticed that quarterbacks at that level may give away the balls destination by where they look before the play, by the way they catch the snap or by where their head turns when they catch the snap.",-1,0
"Love also realized that receivers would make terrible poker players.",-1,0
"It might sound weird, but if Im running Im looking when he turns his head at his eyes, Love says.",-1,0
"If I see his eyes getting wide
Think about it from the receivers perspective.",-1,0
"Youre giving maximum physical exertion, and you have to concentrate on catching a fast-moving oblong spheroid with one or more people waiting to hit you.",-1,0
"Your eyes will turn into saucers when the ball comes near, no matter how badly youd like to hide your anticipation.",-1,0
"Thats not something they can control, Love says.",-1,0
"As Love grew more comfortable with the speed of the game, he learned that on some plays, he could gather this information and turn his head to see the quarterback or the ball.",-1,0
"The fear fried his nerves at first, but it made him better in the long run.",-1,0
"It transitioned to me looking when its appropriate and learning the key details of what the receivers are looking for, Love says.",-1,0
"Julian Loves breakup tip No.",-1,0
"2: Know when to break up and when to make a bigger commitment.",-1,0
"The out route simultaneously offers the most potential glory and the most potential misery for a cornerback.",-1,0
"Jump the route and arrive when the ball does, and it might be a pick-six.",-1,0
"Jump the route too early, and the receiver will make the catch and run all day.",-1,0
"Get caught flat-footed trying to decide whether to jump the route or secure the tackle, and then things can get really embarrassing.",-1,0
"Thats where double moves come into play, Love says.",-1,0
"A double move is a combination of a short route and a much longer route.",-1,0
"A Sluggo (slant and go) is exactly what it sounds like.",-1,0
"On that route, an outside receiver cuts in, plants and pushes straight upfield.",-1,0
"In the out route scenario described above, Love has to beware of the out and up.",-1,0
"A receiver might run an out, then stick his foot in the ground and push upfield when a corner bites on the false route.",-1,0
"But if he reads the quarterbacks tells and reads the receivers eyes, Love can make the correct choice.",-1,0
"And sometimes, a breakup isnt necessary.",-1,0
"Sometimes, its better to pull in rather than push awayespecially when pulling in results in a touchdown for your team.",-1,0
"Julian Loves breakup tip No.",-1,0
"3: Even when youre planning to break up, sometimes you have to stay together and let them down easy (or hard).",-1,0
"When guarding a receiver, Love will use his near arm to try to swat the ball.",-1,0
"The other arm?",-1,0
"Watch as it hovers around the receivers waist.",-1,0
"Love has to be careful because if he gets too handsy with his off arm, he might draw a flag.",-1,0
"But he needs that arm ready to close around the receivers body.",-1,0
"If Love can deflect the ball, great.",-1,0
"But sometimes the pass reaches its intended target.",-1,0
"So Love needs that off arm ready to constrict and make the tackle to keep the receiver from gaining any additional yardage.",-1,0
"Julian Loves breakup tip No.",-1,0
"4: When in doubt, replace his hands.",-1,0
"Todd Lyght, the 12-year NFL veteran who coaches Notre Dames secondary, teaches his DBs that the surest way to break up a pass is to find a way to replace the receivers hands with one of your own.",-1,0
"So even if the quarterback masks where hes throwing the ball and the receivers eyes dont go wide when the ball approaches, the receiver cant fake bringing his hands into position to catch the ball.",-1,0
"The DB has to take care not to shoot his hand between the receivers hands too early, because that would draw a flag if he knocks the receivers hands out of position before the pass reaches its destination.",-1,0
"But if the DB times it correctly, his hand will arrive and take up the space between the receivers hands precisely when the ball arrives.",-1,0
"Now lets watch Loves breakup tips in action.",-1,0
"One of his favorite breakups came in 2017 on a third-and-two play at Stanford.",-1,0
"Love was covering 6'3", 225-pound receiver J.J. Arcega-Whiteside, who basically is a living, breathing third-down conversion.",-1,0
"The defense Notre Dame was playing called for Love to play inside leverage before the snap.",-1,0
"Because of the play Stanford called, that put Love at an immediate disadvantage.",-1,0
"He got a good release off me, Love says.",-1,0
"And I jumped inside to block it, but he wasnt going inside.",-1,0
"I was beat off the release.",-1,0
"Arcega-Whiteside ran a corner route, pushing about 15 yards up the field before angling toward the sideline.",-1,0
"Love, playing catch-up the entire time after getting beat off the line of scrimmage, didnt have much time to look at quarterback K.J.",-1,0
"Costello.",-1,0
"Instead, he used tip No.",-1,0
"1.",-1,0
"Take a look at Arcega-Whitesides eyes as the ball approaches.",-1,0
"That gave Love a basic idea of when the ball would arrive.",-1,0
"He knew by the eyes and the fact that Arcega-Whiteside slowed that Costello had thrown the ball slightly behind where it was supposed to go.",-1,0
"An interception was still impossible, but the slight misfire created a breakup opportunity.",-1,0
"Now, Love just had to replace Arcega-Whitesides hands.",-1,0
"Love held his right hand for a beat as he waited for the ball.",-1,0
"Then he fired it into the gap between Arcega-Whitesides waiting hands just as they began to come together in anticipation of the catch.",-1,0
"When the ball arrived, it struck the back of Loves right handwhich was directly between each of Arcega-Whitesides hands.",-1,0
"Breaking up will always be hard to do, but its a little easier if you follow Loves advice.",-1,0

""And they're very similar to a lot of teams that we play in our division."",-1,0
"Defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul leads the team with 11.5 sacks, followed by defensive end Carl Nassib with 6.5 and defensive tackle Gerald McCoy with 6.",-1,0

"Evans also has 24 receptions of 20-or-more yards, second only to Kansas City's Tyreek Hill.",-1,0
"On the other hand, there should be opportunities for the Dallas secondary to make plays against a Bucs offense that leads the NFL with 25 interceptions, five more than any other team.",-1,0
""Evans, he's elite now," Cowboys defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli said.",-1,0
""Somehow, when he starts scrambling, he finds No.",-1,0
"13.",-1,0
"They do a great job.",-1,0
"They have great chemistry.",-1,0
"[Winston's] a terrific quarterback, mobile guy and in the pocket.",-1,0
"I think he's a winner.",-1,0
"That guy just fights every down.",-1,0
"He's a big-time competitor."",-1,0

"Its not you, wide receivers.",-1,0
"Its Julian Love.",-1,0
"O.K., maybe thats not entirely true.",-1,0
"In any breakupbe it romantic or pass-relatedeach party usually deserves a share of the blame/credit.",-1,0
"And sometimes theres another guy (the quarterback) contributing to the predicament.",-1,0
"This may feel like an inopportune time of year to discuss such matters, but there really is no good time.",-1,0
"So on the eve of Christmas, and fairly close to the eve of the College Football Playoff and a Cotton Bowl matchup against Clemson, Notre Dame cornerback Love is going to teach us how to break up.",-1,0
"Because, as the Fighting Irish video department pointed out earlier this season, the junior from Westchester, Ill., is very good at breaking up.",-1,0
"Julian Loves breakup tip No.",-1,0
"1: Let your fear be your guide.",-1,0
"Love didnt come to Notre Dame expecting to wind up the schools career leader in pass breakups.",-1,0
"In high school, he sought interceptions.",-1,0
"He thought that would continue into college.",-1,0
"Then he found himself on the field as a true freshman at Darrell K RoyalTexas Memorial Stadium during Notre Dames 5047 double-overtime loss to Texas.",-1,0
"A cannon boomed after every Longhorns touchdown, and Love went from thinking about interceptions to thinking about survival.",-1,0
"Love was one of five true freshmen who wound up logging starts in the Notre Dame secondary that season*.",-1,0
"For part of that season, Love was too afraid to turn his head while in coverage.",-1,0
"Youre so nervous that you dont even want to look back for the ball when its thrown, he says.",-1,0
"Its like I dont want to look and miss.",-1,0
"It was just nerves that made me do that early on.",-1,0
"*Want an easy recipe for going 48?",-1,0
"Find yourself in a spot that requires that many young contributors in the defensive backfield.",-1,0
"Though born of fear, that habit taught Love a few things.",-1,0
"First, college quarterbacks might tell you where theyre throwing before the ball is even snapped.",-1,0
"Love noticed that quarterbacks at that level may give away the balls destination by where they look before the play, by the way they catch the snap or by where their head turns when they catch the snap.",-1,0
"Love also realized that receivers would make terrible poker players.",-1,0
"It might sound weird, but if Im running Im looking when he turns his head at his eyes, Love says.",-1,0
"If I see his eyes getting wide
Think about it from the receivers perspective.",-1,0
"Youre giving maximum physical exertion, and you have to concentrate on catching a fast-moving oblong spheroid with one or more people waiting to hit you.",-1,0
"Your eyes will turn into saucers when the ball comes near, no matter how badly youd like to hide your anticipation.",-1,0
"Thats not something they can control, Love says.",-1,0
"As Love grew more comfortable with the speed of the game, he learned that on some plays, he could gather this information and turn his head to see the quarterback or the ball.",-1,0
"The fear fried his nerves at first, but it made him better in the long run.",-1,0
"It transitioned to me looking when its appropriate and learning the key details of what the receivers are looking for, Love says.",-1,0
"Julian Loves breakup tip No.",-1,0
"2: Know when to break up and when to make a bigger commitment.",-1,0
"The out route simultaneously offers the most potential glory and the most potential misery for a cornerback.",-1,0
"Jump the route and arrive when the ball does, and it might be a pick-six.",-1,0
"Jump the route too early, and the receiver will make the catch and run all day.",-1,0
"Get caught flat-footed trying to decide whether to jump the route or secure the tackle, and then things can get really embarrassing.",-1,0
"Thats where double moves come into play, Love says.",-1,0
"A double move is a combination of a short route and a much longer route.",-1,0
"A Sluggo (slant and go) is exactly what it sounds like.",-1,0
"On that route, an outside receiver cuts in, plants and pushes straight upfield.",-1,0
"In the out route scenario described above, Love has to beware of the out and up.",-1,0
"A receiver might run an out, then stick his foot in the ground and push upfield when a corner bites on the false route.",-1,0
"But if he reads the quarterbacks tells and reads the receivers eyes, Love can make the correct choice.",-1,0
"And sometimes, a breakup isnt necessary.",-1,0
"Sometimes, its better to pull in rather than push awayespecially when pulling in results in a touchdown for your team.",-1,0
"Julian Loves breakup tip No.",-1,0
"3: Even when youre planning to break up, sometimes you have to stay together and let them down easy (or hard).",-1,0
"When guarding a receiver, Love will use his near arm to try to swat the ball.",-1,0
"The other arm?",-1,0
"Watch as it hovers around the receivers waist.",-1,0
"Love has to be careful because if he gets too handsy with his off arm, he might draw a flag.",-1,0
"But he needs that arm ready to close around the receivers body.",-1,0
"If Love can deflect the ball, great.",-1,0
"But sometimes the pass reaches its intended target.",-1,0
"So Love needs that off arm ready to constrict and make the tackle to keep the receiver from gaining any additional yardage.",-1,0
"Julian Loves breakup tip No.",-1,0
"4: When in doubt, replace his hands.",-1,0
"Todd Lyght, the 12-year NFL veteran who coaches Notre Dames secondary, teaches his DBs that the surest way to break up a pass is to find a way to replace the receivers hands with one of your own.",-1,0
"So even if the quarterback masks where hes throwing the ball and the receivers eyes dont go wide when the ball approaches, the receiver cant fake bringing his hands into position to catch the ball.",-1,0
"The DB has to take care not to shoot his hand between the receivers hands too early, because that would draw a flag if he knocks the receivers hands out of position before the pass reaches its destination.",-1,0
"But if the DB times it correctly, his hand will arrive and take up the space between the receivers hands precisely when the ball arrives.",-1,0
"Now lets watch Loves breakup tips in action.",-1,0
"One of his favorite breakups came in 2017 on a third-and-two play at Stanford.",-1,0
"Love was covering 6'3", 225-pound receiver J.J. Arcega-Whiteside, who basically is a living, breathing third-down conversion.",-1,0
"The defense Notre Dame was playing called for Love to play inside leverage before the snap.",-1,0
"Because of the play Stanford called, that put Love at an immediate disadvantage.",-1,0
"He got a good release off me, Love says.",-1,0
"And I jumped inside to block it, but he wasnt going inside.",-1,0
"I was beat off the release.",-1,0
"Arcega-Whiteside ran a corner route, pushing about 15 yards up the field before angling toward the sideline.",-1,0
"Love, playing catch-up the entire time after getting beat off the line of scrimmage, didnt have much time to look at quarterback K.J.",-1,0
"Costello.",-1,0
"Instead, he used tip No.",-1,0
"1.",-1,0
"Take a look at Arcega-Whitesides eyes as the ball approaches.",-1,0
"That gave Love a basic idea of when the ball would arrive.",-1,0
"He knew by the eyes and the fact that Arcega-Whiteside slowed that Costello had thrown the ball slightly behind where it was supposed to go.",-1,0
"An interception was still impossible, but the slight misfire created a breakup opportunity.",-1,0
"Now, Love just had to replace Arcega-Whitesides hands.",-1,0
"Love held his right hand for a beat as he waited for the ball.",-1,0
"Then he fired it into the gap between Arcega-Whitesides waiting hands just as they began to come together in anticipation of the catch.",-1,0
"When the ball arrived, it struck the back of Loves right handwhich was directly between each of Arcega-Whitesides hands.",-1,0
"Breaking up will always be hard to do, but its a little easier if you follow Loves advice.",-1,0
