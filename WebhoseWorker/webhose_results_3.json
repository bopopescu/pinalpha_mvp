The incident is the latest sign of the Chinese government\u2019s growing assertiveness in preventing foreign citizens from leaving the country in connection with investigations. Swiss banks occupy a difficult niche in China. They are widely known for protecting clients\u2019 secrecy, although the United States government has been chipping away at Switzerland\u2019s stringent regulations. Singapore also has strict bank secrecy laws, and has become a popular place for many Asians to park their money beyond the easy scrutiny of tax investigators and the police. Preventing a Swiss bank manager from leaving China until she speaks to the authorities could represent a new challenge to banking secrecy. Xi Jinping has embarked on an extensive anticorruption campaign in the six years since he became China\u2019s leader as the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. The campaign has also been used to enforce political loyalty to him. A growing number of multinational companies have begun reviewing their travel policies on mainland China. Some of these have been companies that may have been victims of Chinese industrial espionage or trade violations, such as dumping or export subsidies. \u201cAs the crackdown has intensified we\u2019ve seen more frequent cases where foreign firms introduce temporary, precautionary restrictions for a specific reason \u2014 usually involving the possibility of staff detention in connection with investigations,\u201d said Andrew Gilholm, a Shanghai-based analyst with Control Risks, a global consulting company. The Chinese government has also prevented the departure of family members of people living in the United States. That has become a popular way to put pressure on overseas targets of investigations for them to return to China even when Beijing does not have enough evidence to extradite them. The UBS client adviser, a Singaporean woman, tried to check in for her flight at Beijing International Airport last Friday, only for the airline counter employee to give her a phone number to call instead of her boarding pass, said a person with detailed knowledge of the case who insisted on anonymity because of the legal issues involved. When the woman called the number, she was told that the authorities in another Chinese city wanted to talk to her this week, the person said. The woman returned to her Beijing hotel, moved about the city without difficulty over the weekend, and was planning to fly to the other Chinese city early this week, the person said. The woman was not told that either she or UBS was under investigation, the person said. The names of the UBS adviser and her Chinese clients have not been disclosed. The travel warning to the bank\u2019s wealth managers covers 50 to 100 people, mostly based in Hong Kong or Singapore, but is not an actual travel ban. Some of them are continuing to make trips to mainland China this week after checking with their superiors, so as to keep appointments made previously, the person said. The bank\u2019s investment banking, asset management and back-office operations have not been covered by the travel advisory. The travel restriction on the woman and UBS\u2019s response were first reported on Sunday by Bloomberg. Big American financial institutions like Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs continued to allow their employees to come and go from mainland China on Monday without travel restrictions.\nFollow Keith Bradsher on Twitter: @KeithBradsher .

"text": "UBS: Caught Up by Reality Page 1 of 4\nUBS shareholders have reason to feel aggrieved: the share price is going nowhere and the outlook for the business doesn't signal a soon-to-come dramatic reversal of fortune. CEO Sergio Ermotti needs to do something incisive and finews.asia has designed ten scenarios.\nOnce again, the outlook for the third-quarter results of Switzerland largest bank aren't boding too well. UBS boss Sergio Ermotti may be under pressure to come up with something substantial to say at the investor day next Thursday, an event it will stage on the same day that the quarterly results are due for publication.\nThe top executive is shy of showing displeasure with the share price. The finews.asia team has ten suggestions for measures that might stoke some fire and generate a greater sense of expectation for the Swiss-based bank.\n1. Major Acquisition \u2013 Like Julius Baer?\nA pre-emptive strike with a big acquisition: an option which UBS has consistently shunned in recent years. UBS\u2019 conundrum: as the world\u2019s largest private bank, what else could it possibly buy? Local players in hot markets like DBS or OCBC in Singapore would surely whet the Swiss bank\u2019s appetite, if they were available. Or why not Julius Baer, which has reinvented itself from a sleepy private bank into a serious global contender?\nThe likelihood of a huge step is inextricably linked to the availability and suitability of targets: \u00abIt takes two to tango\u00bb.\n2. Less Boredom, More Risk\nWhether a riskier bank is more attractive for investors depends on how well it can manage risk-taking. UBS stands out as particularly cautious and prudent with its capital since the 2008 rescue. A more relaxed stance would serve its private bank, where the wider industry is generally playing looser with balance sheet to win clients. Compared to Credit Suisse and Julius Baer, UBS is a cautious lender to the wealthy.\nMore risk would be advisable \u2013 and is a probable option for UBS\u2019 wealth arm to return to healthy growth rates. <<", "thread": {"country": "CH", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": "https://www.finews.asia/images/news/2018/10/Weber_Ermotti_500.jpg", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T08:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "finews.asia: Where Finance Meets", "site": "finews.asia", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "site_full": "www.finews.asia", "site_section": "http://www.finews.asia/?format=feed&type=atom", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "UBS: Ten Steps to a Brighter Future", "title_full": "UBS: Ten Steps to a Brighter Future", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT6l3LBGBX1dQO9Z.uOiECMq.lUnhDxv__1Xe3Gj2Cf2o5ZH9LbU2QLa.ntncGdXdF0mtPJ7kWi26V5oPz8W8UbEcI1DhlnRuPklZaKu5Nwa0gum9QikzXgsT2Jn0rvE7QhXW4moviVHvbitdKEkM5LfIHbzy_3tPI-", "uuid": "37a44df2476400bf7870b4fd6c1dcd40f2a561bb"}, "title": "UBS: Ten Steps to a Brighter Future", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT6l3LBGBX1dQO9Z.uOiECMq.lUnhDxv__1Xe3Gj2Cf2o5ZH9LbU2QLa.ntncGdXdF0mtPJ7kWi26V5oPz8W8UbEcI1DhlnRuPklZaKu5Nwa0gum9QikzXgsT2Jn0rvE7QhXW4moviVHvbitdKEkM5LfIHbzy_3tPI-", "uuid": "37a44df2476400bf7870b4fd6c1dcd40f2a561bb"}, {"author": "bullfax.com", "crawled": "2018-10-22T10:57:52.052+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "china warning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": []}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T10:22:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "Warning comes as one of the Swiss bank\u2019s wealth managers in Beijing is asked to aid in an investigation", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": "", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T10:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Market News and Analysis -

The incident is the latest sign of the Chinese government\u2019s growing assertiveness in preventing foreign citizens from leaving the country in connection with investigations. Swiss banks occupy a difficult niche in China. They are widely known for protecting clients\u2019 secrecy, although the United States government has been chipping away at Switzerland\u2019s stringent regulations. Singapore also has strict bank secrecy laws, and has become a popular place for many Asians to park their money beyond the easy scrutiny of tax investigators and the police. Preventing a Swiss bank manager from leaving China until she speaks to the authorities could represent a new challenge to banking secrecy. Xi Jinping has embarked on an extensive anticorruption campaign in the six years since he became China\u2019s leader as the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. The campaign has also been used to enforce political loyalty to him. A growing number of multinational companies have begun reviewing and sometimes tightening their travel policies on mainland China. Some of these have been victims of Chinese industrial espionage or trade violations, such as dumping or export subsidies. \u201cAs the crackdown has intensified we\u2019ve seen more frequent cases where foreign firms introduce temporary, precautionary restrictions for a specific reason \u2014 usually involving the possibility of staff detention in connection with investigations,\u201d said Andrew Gilholm, a Shanghai-based analyst with Control Risks, a global consulting company. The Chinese government has also prevented the departure of family members of people living in the United States. That has become a popular way to put pressure on overseas targets of investigations for them to return to China even when Beijing does not have enough evidence to extradite them. The UBS client adviser, a Singaporean woman, tried to check in for her flight at Beijing International Airport last Friday, only for the airline counter employee to give her a phone number to call instead of her boarding pass, said a person with detailed knowledge of the case who insisted on anonymity because of the legal issues involved. When the woman called the number, she was told that the authorities in another Chinese city wanted to talk to her this week, the person said. The woman returned to her Beijing hotel, moved about the city without difficulty over the weekend, and was planning to fly to the other Chinese city early this week, the person said. The woman was not told that either she or UBS was under investigation, the person said. The names of the UBS adviser and her Chinese clients have not been disclosed. The travel warning to the bank\u2019s wealth managers covers 50 to 100 people, mostly based in Hong Kong or Singapore, but is not an actual travel ban. Some of them are continuing to make trips to mainland China this week after checking with their superiors, so as to keep appointments made previously, the person said. The bank\u2019s investment banking, asset management and back-office operations have not been covered by the travel advisory. The travel restriction on the woman and UBS\u2019s response were first reported on Sunday by Bloomberg. Big American financial institutions like Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs continued to allow their employees to come and go from mainland China on Monday without travel restrictions. The United States issued a travel advisory in January cautioning Americans traveling to China \u2014 particularly if they were born there and had become naturalized American citizens \u2014 that the Chinese government might not allow them to leave if it wanted to put pressure on them or their family members or employer.

Dvaid Rowe by Chanticleer\nIf there is a prize for persistence and determination in the face of powerful negative cyclical forces then Andrew Wood from WorleyParsons is in the box seat to take the trophy.\nSeveral years ago the company he runs was in the doldrums after being hit by a range of forces including a plunge in commodity prices, cost cutting by major resources companies, a freeze on exploration budgets and a wave of asset impairments.\nThree years later the market capitalisation has risen almost six fold and Woods is proceeding with a $4.6 billion takeover offer for the engineering, chemicals and resources division of Jacobs Engineering Group.\nThis is a transformational deal that will double the number of employees, double the revenues and deliver a 20 per cent uplift in earnings in the first full year. The $2.9 billion entitlement offer launched on Monday to help pay for Jacobs' ECR was underwritten by UBS and Macquarie .\nWood will come out of the transaction with his reputation enhanced and his tenure as CEO most likely extended for several years. He has overseen the global expansion of WorleyParsons into a formidable international engineering franchise at just the right time in the economic cycle. Advertisement View all announcements\nWorley Parsons chairman and former CEO John Grill is backing the deal by taking up $100 million worth of stock.\nFurther endorsement of Wood's ability to make the transaction work was shown by Jacobs Engineering deciding to take shares as part settlement for the $4.6 billion price tag. It will end up with 10 per cent of the company.\nThis sets up an interesting situation because there will now be two strategic shareholders on the Worley register \u2013 Jacobs and the the Dar Group, which owns about 26 per cent of the company. It is not known if Dar Group will take up its full entitlement to shares in the share issue.\nThe assets being acquired from Jacobs include the mining and resources engineers who were acquired by Jacobs when it purchased the Australian engineering group SKM for $1.3 billion in 2013.\nIt is generally accepted that Jacobs paid too much for SKM, which was previously known as Sinclair Knight Merz. But that has no bearing on the transaction occurring now.\nHowever, there is one important caveat to the bullish presentation made by the company on Monday. Worley Parsons is undertaking a \"bet-the-company\" transaction.\nThe last time a company did that with an international acquisition was Boral's $3.5 billion takeover of Headwaters in the United States in November 2016. The jury is still out in relation to that deal.\nWorleyParsons has made a number of smaller strategic acquisitions since overcoming the downward pressure on profits caused by the collapse in commodity prices several years ago. It is well versed in the integration of businesses.\nObservers say that the Jacobs ECR business is complementary to the WorleyParsons business which is why it was wise for WorleyParsons to leave out any synergy benefits from its forecasts on earnings per share accretion. The company does expect to achieve synergy benefits of $130 million within two years.\nThat is not to say that Wood won't find opportunities for cost cutting once the deal is done. Worley Parsons confirmed on Monday that it would deliver a profit for the half year to December of between $140 million and $150 million which suggests seven per cent growth on the first half result last year.\nClose watchers of the engineering services market still talk about boom and bust in the sector. One of the best examples of this is the enrolment numbers in mining engineering, which is at unprecedented lows.\nFigures published earlier this year in a chart pack prepared by Saracen Mining showed that mining engineering enrolments in Australia are at record lows. The student numbers are 30 times lower than in 2008 when there was a boom under way.\nTony Boyd ", "thread": {"country": "AU", "domain_rank": 16906, "main_image": "https://www.afr.com/content/dam/images/g/u/h/9/l/t/image.related.socialLead.620x349.h16yki.png/1540192627592.jpg", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-21T23:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Financial Review - Business, Finance and Investment News | afr.com", "site": "afr.com", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "site_full": "www.afr.com", "site_section": "https://www.afr.com/", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "A $4.6b deal helps WorleyParsons build its global franchise", "title_full": "A $4.6b deal helps WorleyParsons build its global franchise | afr.com", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSONYI1RbA4jzMX0Xt5LtQ7855WZwIpmqt2cg1HmE_XjpAHtCNVhl7AAeSC1BZgf9MQsEAw7nHMjCdH9XcoXeACpd24D.u2BUxUZoG_3kil4WQgPwTzIsjGZhqDRl_oq4bYCcrGLgkxDeuGsYSXB5QC", "uuid": "dd8a3bf48582b14bf446cacf8e631e1414b9a9f6"}, "title": "A $4.6b deal helps WorleyParsons build its global franchise", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSONYI1RbA4jzMX0Xt5LtQ7855WZwIpmqt2cg1HmE_XjpAHtCNVhl7AAeSC1BZgf9MQsEAw7nHMjCdH9XcoXeACpd24D.u2BUxUZoG_3kil4WQgPwTzIsjGZhqDRl_oq4bYCcrGLgkxDeuGsYSXB5QC", "uuid": "dd8a3bf48582b14bf446cacf8e631e1414b9a9f6"}, {"author": "afr.com", "crawled": "2018-10-22T12:01:28.029+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [], "organizations": [{"name": "worleyparsons", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "macquarie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macquarie capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "john grill", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "worley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim rice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah thompson anthony macdonald worleyparsons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacob", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-21T17:06:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "Terms out for $2.9b WorleyParsons raising Share WorleyParsons chairman John Grill is tipping fresh funds into the company as part of an equity raising.

BNP Paribas and JPMorgan also asked their private banking employees to reconsider their China travel plans after the authorities' action against the UBS banker, two people said.\nThe Singapore-based UBS banker, who is a client relationship manager in the Swiss bank's wealth management unit, still has her passport, but was last week asked to delay her departure from Beijing and remain in China to meet with local authority officials this week.

Her identity was not known.\nThe purpose of the meeting with Chinese authorities is not clear. UBS has declined to comment on the matter. However, the uncertainty has led the Swiss bank, and now several of its rivals, to require their private banking staff carefully consider trips to China, the sources said.\nTheir caution highlights the risks involved for the global private banks in pursuing what is arguably the biggest opportunity worldwide in the wealth management business.\nChina is the biggest growth driver of the wealth industry in Asia with its large and growing pool of millionaires and billionaires spawned by the country\u2019s booming technology sector, making it a key battleground for global private banks.\nBut its financial sector is under sharp scrutiny as Beijing attempts to lower high debt levels in the economy and rein in the flow of capital outside the country to shore up the yuan, meaning there is very little room for error by industry players.\nUBS is unusual in having an onshore wealth management business in China as well as its offshore operations, but almost all other banks advise wealthy Chinese individuals from offshore locations mainly in Hong Kong and Singapore.\nMost offshore wealth managers travel frequently to China for informal meetings with clients, but they are not allowed to either solicit onshore business or market widely offshore investments to onshore clients.\nCiti asked staff in its Asia Pacific private banking team, via a brief email on Sunday, to postpone all China travel, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nJPMorgan has informally advised its private banking managers to review their upcoming China travel plans, three people said.\nBank of Singapore, the private banking arm of Singapore\u2019s OCBC Bank, has told staff they can continue with their ongoing China trips, but should be cautious in future travel to the mainland, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\nBNP, Citi, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered and Bank of Singapore declined to comment.

The bank has appealed for possession of the mansion overlooking Regent's Park on grounds that the mortgage has expired and not been repaid, according to a report by The Times of India. The court will now hear the matter on October 24.\n\u00a9 Reuters UBS has made the claim in business and property court of the UK High Court against defendants Rose Capital Ventures Ltd, a British Virgin Islands-based company owned by a Mallya family trust, Vijay Mallya, his mother Lalitha Mallya and son Sidhartha Mallya, the report said. Rose Capital Ventures took out a five-year interest only mortgage from UBS on the mansion - 18 and 19 Cornwall Terrace - for 20.4 million pounds (Rs 195 crore) back in March 2012.\nIn Pics: Vijay Mallya's life in pictures\nThe shares in Rose Capital are owned by Gladco, which is owned by the Sileta trust, a Mallya family trust, according to information which UBS attributes to Vijay Mallya. His mother and son live in the mansion and are also the beneficiaries of this trust. Rose Capital had bought the property and incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on October 3, 20005 for 5.4 million pounds (Rs 52 crore), as per the TOI report. According to the title deeds, freehold rights to the property lies with Crown Estate, namely the Queen.\nIn its claim, UBS has stated that the defendants have refused to vacate the property despite the loan's expiry and its requests in this regard. The Swiss bank wants the court to declare that the defendants, Mallya and his family members, are not entitled to enter or stay on the property.\nSponsored: Make the most of the festival season!

Apply now!\nUBS has also requested that Rose Capital pays the outstanding amount of the loan, which as on September 1, 2017, amounts to 20.718,236 (Rs 198 crore) as per the bank's claims. In its claim, UBS said that it terminated the loan early on June 9, 2016, and since it was not repaid, the bank appointed two receivers who initiated proceedings against the four defendants and the housekeeper for the property's possession in November 2016. The housekeeper vacated after a court order in June, 2017.\nDownload the Microsoft News app for your Android or iPhone device and get news & live updates on the go.

However, the uncertainty has led the Swiss bank, and now several of its rivals, to require their private banking staff carefully consider trips to China, the sources said.\nTheir caution highlights the risks involved for the global private banks in pursuing what is arguably the biggest opportunity worldwide in the wealth management business.\nChina is the biggest growth driver of the wealth industry in Asia with its large and growing pool of millionaires and billionaires spawned by the country's booming technology sector, making it a key battleground for global private banks.\nBut its financial sector is under sharp scrutiny as Beijing attempts to lower high debt levels in the economy and rein in the flow of capital outside the country to shore up the yuan, meaning there is very little room for error by industry players.\nUBS is unusual in having an onshore wealth management business in China as well as its offshore operations, but almost all other banks advise wealthy Chinese individuals from offshore locations mainly in Hong Kong and Singapore.\nMost offshore wealth managers travel frequently to China for informal meetings with clients, but they are not allowed to either solicit onshore business or market widely offshore investments to onshore clients.\nCiti asked staff in its Asia Pacific private banking team, via a brief email on Sunday, to postpone all China travel, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nJPMorgan has informally advised its private banking managers to review their upcoming China travel plans, three people said.\nBank of Singapore, the private banking arm of Singapore's OCBC Bank , has told staff they can continue with their ongoing China trips, but should be cautious in future travel to the mainland, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\nBNP, Citi, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered and Bank of Singapore declined to comment. All the sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nUBS is the largest wealth manager operating in Asia, with $383 billion of assets under management, according to Asian Private Banker magazine, ahead of Citi, Credit Suisse , HSBC and Julius Baer .\nThe number of high net-worth individuals - those with at least $1 million to invest - rose by 12 percent last year in Asia Pacific, exceeding growth rates anywhere else in the world, according to consultant CapGemini.\n(Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee and Clare Jim; Additional reporting by Julie Zhu, Kane Wu and Anshuman Daga; Editing by Jennifer Hughes and Muralikumar Anantharaman)", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": 283, "main_image": "", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T15:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Finance - Business Insider", "site": "businessinsider.com", "site_categories": ["media", "financial_news", "finance"], "site_full": "www.businessinsider.com", "site_section": "http://www.businessinsider.com/clusterstock", "site_type": "blogs", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Global banks curb China travel after UBS private banker stopped from leaving", "title_full": "Global banks curb China travel after UBS private banker stopped from leaving - Business Insider", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8v3BmVd24meuL1ei1Bo_4WxV.oMyF3BCHCAKB7VFcCqIpOydlW8rVbVmVb4oLdPxoPsaeo.BeCbPvBElUFX0I6LZyYaOybsqBmDj_PknsgHsl7_LnCrYFNfuC.WU990z_ZYdecAWBDyFJi2w5u9l2v", "uuid": "75351a176e7dc289b0bc3d4ad7e3b7b0dd5b9b25"}, "title": "Global banks curb China travel after UBS private banker stopped from leaving", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8v3BmVd24meuL1ei1Bo_4WxV.oMyF3BCHCAKB7VFcCqIpOydlW8rVbVmVb4oLdPxoPsaeo.BeCbPvBElUFX0I6LZyYaOybsqBmDj_PknsgHsl7_LnCrYFNfuC.WU990z_ZYdecAWBDyFJi2w5u9l2v", "uuid": "75351a176e7dc289b0bc3d4ad7e3b7b0dd5b9b25"}, {"author": "www.4-traders.com", "crawled": "2018-10-22T14:57:09.002+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "goldman changes asia banking leadership", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. treasury department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs cautions private bankers on travel", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "isaac", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "Banks' Golden Deposits Are Heading Out the Door\nAfter years of rate increases from the Federal Reserve, customers are pulling money out of accounts that don't earn interest and putting it into higher-yielding alternatives.

BNP Paribas and JPMorgan also asked their private banking employees to reconsider their China travel plans after the authorities' action against the UBS banker, two people said. The Singapore-based UBS banker, who is a client relationship manager in the Swiss bank's wealth management unit, still has her passport, but was last week asked to delay her departure from Beijing and remain in China to meet with local authority officials this week. Her identity was not known. The purpose of the meeting with Chinese authorities is not clear. UBS has declined to comment on the matter. However, the uncertainty has led the Swiss bank, and now several of its rivals, to require their private banking staff carefully consider trips to China, the sources said. Their caution highlights the risks involved for the global private banks in pursuing what is arguably the biggest opportunity worldwide in the wealth management business. China is the biggest growth driver of the wealth industry in Asia with its large and growing pool of millionaires and billionaires spawned by the country's booming technology sector, making it a key battleground for global private banks. But its financial sector is under sharp scrutiny as Beijing attempts to lower high debt levels in the economy and rein in the flow of capital outside the country to shore up the yuan, meaning there is very little room for error by industry players. UBS is unusual in having an onshore wealth management business in China as well as its offshore operations, but almost all other banks advise wealthy Chinese individuals from offshore locations mainly in Hong Kong and Singapore. Most offshore wealth managers travel frequently to China for informal meetings with clients, but they are not allowed to either solicit onshore business or market widely offshore investments to onshore clients. Citi asked staff in its Asia Pacific private banking team, via a brief email on Sunday, to postpone all China travel, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. JPMorgan has informally advised its private banking managers to review their upcoming China travel plans, three people said. Bank of Singapore, the private banking arm of Singapore's OCBC Bank, has told staff they can continue with their ongoing China trips, but should be cautious in future travel to the mainland, according to people with knowledge of the matter. BNP, Citi, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered and Bank of Singapore declined to comment. All the sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. UBS is the largest wealth manager operating in Asia, with $383 billion of assets under management, according to Asian Private Banker magazine, ahead of Citi, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Julius Baer. The number of high net-worth individuals \u2013 those with at least $1 million to invest \u2013 rose by 12 percent last year in Asia Pacific, exceeding growth rates anywhere else in the world, according to consultant CapGemini.

BNP Paribas and JPMorgan have also asked their private banking employees to reconsider their China travel plans after the authorities' action against the UBS banker, two people familiar with the matter said.\nSwiss private bank Julius Baer, which manages assets worth $390 billion globally, has asked staff to be cautious about China travel plans, a separate person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nThe Singapore-based UBS banker, who is a client relationship manager in the Swiss bank's wealth management unit, still has her passport, but was last week asked to delay her departure from Beijing and remain in China to meet with local authority officials this week. Her identity was not known.\nThe purpose of the meeting with Chinese authorities is not clear. UBS has declined to comment on the matter. However, the uncertainty has led the Swiss bank, and now several of its rivals, to require their private banking staff carefully consider trips to China, the sources said.\nTheir caution highlights the risks involved for global private banks in pursuing what is arguably the biggest opportunity worldwide in the wealth management business.\nChina is the biggest growth driver of the wealth industry in Asia with its large and growing pool of millionaires and billionaires spawned by the country's booming technology sector, making it a key battleground for global private banks.\nBut its financial sector is under sharp scrutiny as Beijing attempts to lower high debt levels in the economy and curb an outflow of capital from the country to shore up the yuan, meaning there is very little room for error by industry players.\nBNP, Citi, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, and Julius Baer declined to comment. All the sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nFREQUENT TRAVEL\nUBS is unusual in having an onshore wealth management business in China as well as its offshore operations, but almost all other banks advise wealthy Chinese individuals from offshore locations mainly in Hong Kong and Singapore.\nMost offshore wealth managers travel frequently to China for informal meetings with clients, but they are not allowed to either solicit onshore business or market widely offshore investments to onshore clients.\nCiti asked staff in its Asia Pacific private banking team, via a brief email on Sunday, to postpone all China travel, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nJPMorgan has informally advised its private banking managers to review their upcoming China travel plans, three people said.\nBank of Singapore, the private banking arm of Singapore's OCBC Bank, has told staff they can continue with their ongoing China trips, but should be cautious in future travel to the mainland, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\nA Bank of Singapore spokesman declined to comment.\nUBS is the largest wealth manager operating in Asia, with $383 billion of assets under management, according to Asian Private Banker magazine, ahead of Citi, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Julius Baer.\nCredit Suisse has not imposed any travel ban on its private bankers on China travel, a spokeswoman said.\nThe number of high net-worth individuals \u2013 those with at least $1 million to invest \u2013 rose by 12 percent last year in Asia Pacific, exceeding growth rates anywhere else in the world, according to consultant CapGemini.\n(Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee and Clare Jim; Additional reporting by Julie Zhu, Kane Wu, Anshuman Daga in Hong Kong, Oliver Hirt and Angelika Gruber in Zurich; Editing by Jennifer Hughes and Muralikumar Anantharaman/Emelia Sithole-Matarise)\nBy Sumeet Chatterjee and Clare Jim", "thread": {"country": "FR", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": "https://img.zonebourse.com/reuters/2018-10-22T134204Z_4_LYNXNPEE9L0VV-OCABS_RTROPTP_3_CBUSINESS-US-UBS-GROUP-CHINA-BANKER.JPG", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Stock market news - Company News  - MarketScreener.com", "site": "marketscreener.com", "site_categories": [], "site_full": "www.marketscreener.com", "site_section": "http://www.4-traders.com/rss/FeedNews.php", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Global banks curb China travel after UBS banker stopped from leaving", "title_full": "Global banks curb China travel after UBS banker stopped from leaving", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RsaEXA3kWE_r6N4ZWx.c21FuLe_1BjiFypoXJwv8vayQavgSNy8MtgooRtVzN6EApROt4n1WtvTa._yJYlmpAZgl8AZQVeS89UNRwwxFm0Mb3PVSfGuvLnh4xLHEHNaIdJ1CB7r2L4_aK5Qd4jJeyI_X0_R1oQ_GCashMtqND0wsw1LbdHl46NI-", "uuid": "a6c2b2b904f922367f9ae91d7b3c3384224b790f"}, "title": "Global banks curb China travel after UBS banker stopped from leaving", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RsaEXA3kWE_r6N4ZWx.c21FuLe_1BjiFypoXJwv8vayQavgSNy8MtgooRtVzN6EApROt4n1WtvTa._yJYlmpAZgl8AZQVeS89UNRwwxFm0Mb3PVSfGuvLnh4xLHEHNaIdLqCn7ydrrj3", "uuid": "d346903f0b6a2e46da60b2ae5a774eb888457fd7"}, {"author": "Danalynne Menegus", "crawled": "2018-10-22T17:29:30.000+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "fides", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "client relations and marketing fides treasury services ltd.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "credit suisse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "kaufmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandra liechti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liechti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon kaufmann", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": ["https://conference.afponline.org/"], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "Fides Hires Assistant Vice President, Client Relations and Marketing Share Article Alexandra Liechti joins multi-banking services provider to expand market reach \u201cI believe that Fides offers the best bank connectivity solutions on the market today and am proud to represent them.\u201d \u2014 Alexandra Liechti, Vice President, Client Relations and Marketing, Fides Treasury Services ZURICH Fides Treasury Services Ltd., the global leader in multi-bank connectivity and communications, has announced the hire of Alexandra Liechti as Assistant Vice President, Client Relations and Marketing.

BNP Paribas and JPMorgan have also asked their private banking employees to reconsider their China travel plans after the authorities' action against the UBS banker, two people familiar with the matter said.\nSwiss private bank Julius Baer, which manages assets worth $390 billion globally, has asked staff to be cautious about China travel plans, a separate person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nThe Singapore-based UBS banker, who is a client relationship manager in the Swiss bank's wealth management unit, still has her passport, but was last week asked to delay her departure from Beijing and remain in China to meet with local authority officials this week. Her identity was not known.\nThe purpose of the meeting with Chinese authorities is not clear. UBS has declined to comment on the matter. However, the uncertainty has led the Swiss bank, and now several of its rivals, to require their private banking staff carefully consider trips to China, the sources said.\nTheir caution highlights the risks involved for global private banks in pursuing what is arguably the biggest opportunity worldwide in the wealth management business.\nChina is the biggest growth driver of the wealth industry in Asia with its large and growing pool of millionaires and billionaires spawned by the country's booming technology sector, making it a key battleground for global private banks.\nBut its financial sector is under sharp scrutiny as Beijing attempts to lower high debt levels in the economy and curb an outflow of capital from the country to shore up the yuan, meaning there is very little room for error by industry players.\nBNP, Citi, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, and Julius Baer declined to comment. All the sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nFREQUENT TRAVEL\nUBS is unusual in having an onshore wealth management business in China as well as its offshore operations, but almost all other banks advise wealthy Chinese individuals from offshore locations mainly in Hong Kong and Singapore.\nMost offshore wealth managers travel frequently to China for informal meetings with clients, but they are not allowed to either solicit onshore business or market widely offshore investments to onshore clients.\nCiti asked staff in its Asia Pacific private banking team, via a brief email on Sunday, to postpone all China travel, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nJPMorgan has informally advised its private banking managers to review their upcoming China travel plans, three people said.\nBank of Singapore, the private banking arm of Singapore's OCBC Bank, has told staff they can continue with their ongoing China trips, but should be cautious in future travel to the mainland, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\nA Bank of Singapore spokesman declined to comment.\nUBS is the largest wealth manager operating in Asia, with $383 billion of assets under management, according to Asian Private Banker magazine, ahead of Citi, Credit Suisse , HSBC and Julius Baer.\nCredit Suisse has not imposed any travel ban on its private bankers on China travel, a spokeswoman said.\nThe number of high net-worth individuals \u2013 those with at least $1 million to invest \u2013 rose by 12 percent last year in Asia Pacific, exceeding growth rates anywhere else in the world, according to consultant CapGemini.\n(Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee and Clare Jim; Additional reporting by Julie Zhu, Kane Wu, Anshuman Daga in Hong Kong, Oliver Hirt and Angelika Gruber in Zurich; Editing by Jennifer Hughes and Muralikumar Anantharaman/Emelia Sithole-Matarise)\nBy Sumeet Chatterjee and Clare Jim\nStocks treated in this article : BNP Paribas , Citigroup , Standard Chartered , Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.

On the weekend, a Singapore-based UBS employee on the relationship management team who traveled to China to meet with clients was requested by government officials to remain and meet with authorities, according to several industry reports. The reason is unknown.\nUBS then recommended in an internal memo that a team of regional advisors delay travel plans to the country, according to a Reuters report, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter.\nIn view of what appears to be a detention, and given some recent high profile detentions in China, Julius Baer also advised its relationship managers to delay trips to the country, according to a separate report from Bloomberg.\nThe same report cited a spokesman at Credit Suisse saying no travel ban was in place for its staff.\nFSA contacted HSBC Private Bank and Standard Chartered, which have mainland operations and ambitions. Both banks declined to comment on whether a similar policy is in place for employees traveling to China.\nChina authorities have been tightening control over onshore wealth and asset management as the mainland\u2019s private wealth increases.\nBut the reasons for mainland officials to detain the UBS employee remain unclear. UBS Group has established an onshore China foothold with a banking arm, securities house and asset management firm . Recently, the bank\u2019s state-owned partners in UBS Securities, a joint venture brokerage, agreed to transfer their stakes to UBS.

READ: Rightmove downgraded; UBS recommends cashing in on merger mania\nBack in July, UBS was among those advising investors to cash in on the merger mania sparked by Silver Lake\u2019s bid for Rightmove\u2019s smaller rival, ZPG (which operates Zoopla ). Now, it thinks the sell-off has been overdone.\n\u201cWe believe features of Rightmove\u2019s model protect it from concerns over Brexit and competition. Specifically, 1) Rightmove operates a s UBS cription model that is not sensitive in the short term to transaction volumes and prices; 2) We think vendors will rarely award instructions to agents who do not use Rightmove, and 3) Rightmove\u2019s products are fully integrated with agent workflow and designed to increase share of instructions, a key agent KPI [key performance indicator],\u201d UBS said.\nBased on UBS\u2019s forecasts for 2019, Rightmove is trading at 22 times forecast earnings per share, which is 15% below its five-year average.\nUBS\u2019s own evidence lab suggests that demand for Rightmove\u2019s product has remained stable since the beginning of the year.\nListing volumes in October were up year-on-year, which UBS suggests means agents\u2019 use of Rightmove remains strong, while data from market research group suggests that growth in traffic on the rival On The Market site has come at the expense of Zoopla rather than Rightmove. For those who don't see #portaljuggling as a problem. Same property, same agent, two sets of dates.

We expect Rightmove to price less aggressively in 2019 to reflect this reality and maintain good relationships with agents,\u201d UBS said, as it cut its estimate of growth in the average revenue per user between 2019 and 2021 to 8% from 8.5% previously. Thee change feeds through to a downgrade of less than 1% of forecast earnings per share over the 2019-21 period.\nUBS has a 12-month price target of 490p.

Her identity was not known.\nThe purpose of the meeting with Chinese authorities is not clear. UBS has declined to comment on the matter. However, the uncertainty has led the Swiss bank, and now several of its rivals, to require their private banking staff carefully consider trips to China, the sources said.\nTheir caution highlights the risks involved for global private banks in pursuing what is arguably the biggest opportunity worldwide in the wealth management business.\nChina is the biggest growth driver of the wealth industry in Asia with its large and growing pool of millionaires and billionaires spawned by the country\u2019s booming technology sector, making it a key battleground for global private banks.\nBut its financial sector is under sharp scrutiny as Beijing attempts to lower high debt levels in the economy and curb an outflow of capital from the country to shore up the yuan, meaning there is very little room for error by industry players.\nBNP, Citi, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, and Julius Baer declined to comment. All the sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nFREQUENT TRAVEL\nUBS is unusual in having an onshore wealth management business in China as well as its offshore operations, but almost all other banks advise wealthy Chinese individuals from offshore locations mainly in Hong Kong and Singapore.\nMost offshore wealth managers travel frequently to China for informal meetings with clients, but they are not allowed to either solicit onshore business or market widely offshore investments to onshore clients.\nCiti asked staff in its Asia Pacific private banking team, via a brief email on Sunday, to postpone all China travel, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nJPMorgan has informally advised its private banking managers to review their upcoming China travel plans, three people said.\nBank of Singapore, the private banking arm of Singapore\u2019s OCBC Bank, has told staff they can continue with their ongoing China trips, but should be cautious in future travel to the mainland, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\nA Bank of Singapore spokesman declined to comment.\nUBS is the largest wealth manager operating in Asia, with $383 billion of assets under management, according to Asian Private Banker magazine, ahead of Citi, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Julius Baer.\nCredit Suisse has not imposed any travel ban on its private bankers on China travel, a spokeswoman said.\nThe number of high net-worth individuals \u2013 those with at least $1 million to invest \u2013 rose by 12 percent last year in Asia Pacific, exceeding growth rates anywhere else in the world, according to consultant CapGemini.

In statement published in the Financial Times on Tuesday, the bank said,\"UBS would like to confirm that we allow all our staff to travel freely in and out of the country and it is business as usual for us in China, UBS has had a strong franchise in China for 30 years and remains fully committed to further developing our business on the mainland.\u201d According to the Financial Times and the New York Times on Monday, UBS recommended against travel to China after a Singapore-based UBS banker who had recently travelled to China to advise a wealthy Chinese client was asked to stay in the country to answer questions regarding an undisclosed matter. The banker had not been detained, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company issued an internal memo recommending regional private banking advisors to postpone trips to China until her situation is clarified.

UBS Group, its French unit along with six executives and former executives are accused of helping wealthy clients avoid taxes in France. They are facing charges of aggravated tax fraud and money laundering after a seven-year investigation and aborted settlement negotiations. Defendants in France are allowed on the first day of a trial to raise objections against the case moving forward on the grounds the constitution has been flouted. The court dismissed the bank\u2019s arguments as \u201cdevoid of seriousness\u201d. UBS must also answer to allegations that it illegally solicited clients in France. If found guilty of money laundering, UBS could be fined up to 5 billion euros (CHF5.7 billion) and its executives could also face jail time .\nUBS History Of Tax Evasion Controversy\nThe first major tax evasion controversy the bank was involved in occurred in 2007. Bradley Birkenfeld, an American banker stationed at UBS broke Swiss banking secrecy laws to disclose client information to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) alleging suspected tax evasion. The DOJ opened an investigation which eventually resulted in a settlement with UBS where the bank was fined US$780 million. With this breakthrough by the U.S. and Congress enacting the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (\u201cFATCA\u201d) which is in full force requiring all foreign financial institutions to disclose U.S. accountholders to the U.S., no longer can U.S. taxpayers avoid reporting income on their foreign bank accounts and no longer can U.S. taxpayers avoid disclosing their foreign bank accounts.\nImpact On Holders Of Crypto-currency\nBut with Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, there is no such third party reporting. Digital exchanges are not broker-regulated by the IRS. Digital exchanges are not obligated to issue a 1099 form, nor are they obligated to report to the IRS calculate gains or cost basis for the trader \u2013 but that could be changing sooner than you think!\nIRS Investigative Action\nGiven the ability for taxpayers to engage in bitcoin transactions without proper tax reporting, the IRS though has stepped up its investigation efforts to uncover non-compliant taxpayers.\nA John Doe Summons issued by IRS was ruled enforceable by U.S. Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley in November 2017 (United States v. Coinbase, Inc., United States District Court, Northern District Of California, Case No.17-cv-01431). Coinbase located in San Francisco is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States. Under the order, Coinbase was to turn over the names, addresses and tax identification numbers on 14,355 account holders. The Court ordered Coinbase to produce the following customer information: (1) taxpayer ID number, (2) name, (3) birth date, (4) address, (5) records of account activity, including transaction logs or other records identifying the date, amount, and type of transaction (purchase/sale/ exchange ), the post transaction balance, and the names of counterparties to the transaction, and (6) all periodic statements of account or invoices (or the equivalent). The information was turned over to the U.S. government on March 16, 2018.\nNow while this net may not pick up taxpayers whose accounts have less than $20,000 in any one transaction type (buy, sell, send, or receive) in any one year from 2013 to 2015, it should be clear that this is the first step for the IRS to crush non-compliance for all taxpayers involved with cryptocurrency just like the IRS was successful in battling taxpayers having undisclosed foreign bank accounts.\nPenalties For Filing A False Income Tax Return Or Under-reporting Income\nFailure to report all the money you make is a main reason folks end up facing an IRS auditor. Carelessness on your tax return might get you whacked with a 20% penalty. But that\u2019s nothing compared to the 75% civil penalty for willful tax fraud and possibly facing criminal charges of tax evasion that if convicted could land you in jail.\nCriminal Fraud \u2013 The law defines that any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax under the Internal Revenue Code or the payment thereof is, in addition to other penalties provided by law, guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, can be fined not more than $100,000 ($500,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution (Code Sec. 7201).\nThe term \u201cwillfully\u201d has been interpreted to require a specific intent to violate the law (U.S. v. Pomponio, 429 U.S. 10 (1976)). The term \u201cwillfulness\u201d is defined as the voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty (Cheek v. U.S., 498 U.S. 192 (1991)).\nAnd even if the IRS is not looking to put you in jail, they will be looking to hit you with a big tax bill with hefty penalties.\nCivil Fraud \u2013 Normally the IRS will impose a negligence penalty of 20% of the underpayment of tax (Code Sec. 6662(b)(1) and 6662(b)(2)) but violations of the Internal Revenue Code with the intent to evade income taxes may result in a civil fraud penalty. In lieu of the 20% negligence penalty, the civil fraud penalty is 75% of the underpayment of tax (Code Sec. 6663). The imposition of the Civil Fraud Penalty essentially doubles your liability to the IRS!\nWhat Should You Do?\nThe IRS has not yet announced a specific tax amnesty for people who failed to report their gains and income from Bitcoin and other virtual currencies but under the existing Voluntary Disclosure Program, non-compliant taxpayers can come forward to avoid criminal prosecution and negotiate lower penalties.\nWith only several hundred people reporting their crypto gains each year since bitcoin\u2019s launch, the IRS suspects that many crypto users have been evading taxes by not reporting crypto transactions on their tax returns.\nNow is the ideal time to be proactive and come forward with voluntary disclosure to lock in your deferred gains through 2017, eliminate your risk for criminal prosecution, and minimize your civil penalties. Don\u2019t delay because once the IRS has targeted you for investigation \u2013 even it\u2019s is a routine random audit \u2013 it will be too late voluntarily come forward.

Kahn, P.C. located in Orange County (Irvine), the Bay Area (including San Francisco, San Jose and Walnut Creek) and offices elsewhere in California get you qualified into a voluntary disclosure program to avoid criminal prosecution, seek abatement of penalties, and minimize your tax liability.
