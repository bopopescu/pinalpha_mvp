The bank has applied for possession of the property in the UK High Court, the country\u2019s third highest court, on grounds that the mortgage has expired and not been repaid.\nUBS\u2019s claim against Rose Capital Ventures Ltd, Vijay Mallya, mother Lalitha Mallya and son Sidhartha Mallya, in the business and property court of the High Court, will be heard on October 24. Rose Capital Ventures Ltd took out a five-year interest only mortgage on the property with UBS in March 2012 for \u00a320.4 million (Rs 195 crore).\nMallya, his mother and son live here and are beneficiaries of the trust, UBS states. The shares in Rose Capital are owned by Gladco that is owned by the Sileta trust, a Mallya family trust, Mallya confirms in his defence. Despite the loan\u2019s expiry and the claimant\u2019s request that defendants vacate the property, the defendants have refused to move out, UBS states in its claim.\nUK court grants enforcement order in Vijay Mallya assets case \"The High Court Enforcement Officer, including any enforcement agents acting under his authority, may enter Ladywalk, Queen Hoo Lane, Tewin, Welwyn... and Bramble Lodge, Queen Hoo Lane, Tewin, Welwyn, including all outbuildings of Ladywalk and Bramble Lodge to search for and take control of goods belonging to the First Defendant (Mallya),\" notes the order by Justice Byran, dated June 26.\nThe leasehold property \u2014 18 and 19 Cornwall Terrace \u2014 was purchased by Rose Capital and incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on October 3, 2005, for \u00a35.4 million (Rs 52 crore). Freehold rights to the property belong to the Crown Estate, namely the Queen, as per the title deeds.\nUBS also seeks Rose Capital pay the loan\u2019s outstanding and wants the court to declare that the defendants are not entitled to enter or remain on the property. The amount owed as of September 1, 2017, is \u00a320,718,236 (Rs 198 crore), the bank has alleged.\nThe claim states that UBS terminated the loan early on June 9, 2016. Since the loan was not repaid, the bank appointed receivers who started proceedings against the four defendants and housekeeper for the property\u2019s possession in November 2016. Following a June 2017 court order, the housekeeper vacated, UBS states.\nSince the mortgage expired on March 26, 2017, and the outstanding balance on that date of \u00a320.4 million was still not paid, the proceedings by the receiver were stayed, and the bank decided to bring proceedings to take possession of the property and to sell it, UBS states. An attempt to refinance the loan with CBH Bank by Rose Capital collapsed and \u201cas far as the claimant knows, there are no other potential refinancing options for Rose Capital,\u201d the claim states.\nBarrister Jonathan Gavaghan, of Blake Morgan LLP representing the defendants, denies that UBS has the right to the property.

The banker, who is based in Singapore and works in the relationship management team in UBS's wealth management unit, still has her passport, but was asked to remain in China and meet with local authority officials next week, the person said. The identity and position of the banker were not known. The purpose of the meeting with authorities is not clear, but the bank has asked others in its China wealth management team to review their travel plans carefully. No other units in the bank, including back office or asset management teams, have been asked to re-consider existing travel plans. The Swiss bank is the largest wealth manager operating in Asia, with $383 billion of assets under management, according to Asian Private Banker magazine, ahead of Citigroup, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Julius Baer Bakers. The meeting also comes as UBS has been building up its presence in China. Last week it moved a step closer to becoming the first bank to take majority ownership of its China joint venture under new rules. designed to open up the sector, when two of its current partners put their stakes up for sale. Any deal on the stakes will need the approval of Chinese authorities, who are yet to give the green light for the 51 percent shareholding. ---Reuters, Hong Kong", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": "https://dailyasianage.com/images/fb-image.jpg", "participants_count": 0, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-21T03:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "The Asian Age", "site": "dailyasianage.com", "site_categories": ["media", "education"], "site_full": "dailyasianage.com", "site_section": "https://dailyasianage.com/rss/feed.xml", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "UBS warns staff over China travel", "title_full": "UBS warns staff over China travel", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UcOnrFLwZZN7mCilqJQRtw6csSEpWrBmh3wn0YyZFooqc7fM_lN7fIaNjOwnPw_MUq6Ak8x3TNU3lktsM8Gpka3", "uuid": "b47b64805f9ad1b16991b85b997cced79d4115b5"}, "title": "UBS warns staff over China travel", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UcOnrFLwZZN7mCilqJQRtw6csSEpWrBmh3wn0YyZFooqc7fM_lN7fIaNjOwnPw_MUq6Ak8x3TNU3lktsM8Gpka3", "uuid": "b47b64805f9ad1b16991b85b997cced79d4115b5"}, {"author": "Melissa Cunningham", "crawled": "2018-10-21T02:28:25.004+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "woolworths", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aldi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "retail doctor group", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "aryan norozi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian walker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louie douvis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben gilbert", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-20T16:05:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "By Melissa Cunningham 21 October 2018 \u2014 12:05am After years of consumers benefiting from fierce competition between the big supermarkets driven by Aldi's rapid expansion, the drought across much of the country is forcing Coles and Woolworths to pull back on their discounting of fresh food.\nA report by UBS retail analysts Ben Gilbert and Aryan Norozi released this week suggests that pressure to push up fresh food prices will continue, while competitive discounting between the nation's two major supermarkets will decline.\nWill inflation return? A new report suggests it might. Credit: Louie Douvis\nThe report found the rate of industry deflation has eased off in the most recent quarter, largely due to a surge in the cost of fresh food, including meat and dairy produce.\nFigures reveal prices fell 1.3 per cent at Woolworths in the quarter ending June 30, compared with a 0.6 per cent drop in the September quarter.\nAdvertisement It's a stark comparison with March this year, when prices of fresh food fell by almost 3 per cent according to the report.\nBrian Walker, retail analyst and founder of the Retail Doctor Group, said drought historically meant grocery bills soared due to pressures on affected farmers and suppliers.\nGenerally, experts estimate grocery bills can rise at twice the rate of inflation during a drought.\n\"The message Woolworths and Coles are saying is 'well, in this cycle, we can't discount any further so we have to put some of this cost back onto the consumer',\" Mr Walker said.\nHe said while there weren't likely to be huge increases in the cost of staple products such as milk and bread, harder to source fresh food items are likely to less discounted in the coming months.\nA decade ago Woolworths and Coles had, comparatively, among the world's highest operating return.\nBut the brutal competition that Aldi injected into the entire market was responsible for almost unprecedented levels of price cutting.\n\"If we look at Coles and Woolworths now they've all invested into major store refurbishments, service and price drops,\" Mr Walker said.\n\"What price discounting does is compel consumers to spend more when they're at the supermarket. But they're buying those discounts and they can't keep doing that forever.\"\nThe analysts noted that the easing deflationary pressures were a reflection of higher input costs and suggests further price increases are likely down the track.\nThe report noted that measuring Coles trends was difficult, with the supermarket giant recently matching its online prices to in-store prices, but analysts observed Coles was also showing signs of easing deflation rates consistent with Woolworths.\n\"We are now one step closer to inflation and the market is becoming more rational, a positive for sector sales, margin and valuations,\" the report said. \"We expect easing deflationary trends ... to continue.\"\nColes sales grew by 5 per cent in the first quarter, helped by its recent Little Shop toy giveaway \u2013 the chain's most successful campaign of its type.\nSales came in at $9.84 billion for the three months to September 30, compared with $9.37 billion in the prior corresponding quarter.\nColes managing director Steven Cain said earlier this week the Little Shop campaign would now be evaluated by management given its success.\nA Woolworths spokeswoman said fresh food prices have remained \"relatively stable\" across the board.\n\"We continue to monitor commodity markets and feedback from our industry partners closely,\" she said.\n\"As always, we continue to work hard with our suppliers to offer our customers top quality fresh food at the best prices.\"\nColes has been contacted for comment.\n Retail", "thread": {"country": "AU", "domain_rank": 1534, "main_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0347,$multiply_1,$ratio_1.777778,$width_1059,$x_0,$y_39/t_crop_custom/w_800/t_sharpen,q_auto,f_auto/c2754de41f7101e0e4624e8c1f3f7c8caa3821c0", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-20T16:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "WA Today -

That left investors still looking for ways to protect themselves.\nHedge funds are betting the pound will fall, and the cost of insuring against large moves in the currency has recently risen to highs last seen in March 2017. Other investors are picking British investments they consider Brexit-proof.\n\u0093Nothing has been done, so I don\u0092t see how it can be anything other than a mess,\u0094 said Benjamin Segal, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman.\nInvestors worry that Britain risks leaving the EU without a divorce agreement, a so-called no-deal scenario that could place tariffs on exports and imports flowing between the two sides.\nUBS estimates British output is already 2.1 percent lower than it would have been if Britain had voted to remain in the EU in 2016, with uncertainty crimping investment and sentiment.\nThat ambiguity has pushed investors to protect themselves against \u0096 or make money from \u0096 further falls in sterling.\nThere were 15,300 more short than long contracts on the pound in the week to Oct. 12 in the leveraged-money category, which largely covers hedge funds, according to data from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nThat is a sharp reversal from as recently as April, when such funds held 78,400 more long than short positions, as the pound rose against the euro on expectations of a Brexit deal and a rate increase from the Bank of England.\nSince August, the cost of long-dated currency options \u0096 which help investors protect themselves against large moves in the pound \u0096 has reached its highest level since March 2017.\nSterling, which has been the main barometer of investors\u0092 views on Brexit, has moved with the direction of negotiations.\nThe currency has gained over 3.5 percent against the euro since late August, as officials from both sides of the negotiations signaled a compromise was in the works and, later, when British Prime Minister Theresa May appeared to emerge from her Conservative Party\u0092s annual conference in a stronger position.\nThe pound has drifted lower against the euro since just before Wednesday\u0092s inconclusive summit.\n\u0093The mood music changes and progress, or lack of it, happens and you see it in sterling,\u0094 said John Wraith, who covers UK rates strategy and economics at UBS.\nTo be sure, investors have long been negative on Britain. The pound is still 10 percent below where it was against the euro before the 2016 referendum.\nWhile a cheaper currency has benefited exporters and international companies in the FTSE 100, UK equities have been mainly out of favor with international investors and foreign investment has suffered.\nSegal, for example, has reduced his exposure to the UK. He has sold shares in domestically focused firms like home-improvement retailer Travis Perkins PLC and trimmed holdings in Lloyds Banking Group PLC in favor of groups with a more global business like insurer Prudential PLC.\nOthers are putting money into sectors they see as comparatively resistant to the impact of Brexit.\nLuiz Sauerbronn, a director of the investments group at Brandes Investment Partners, cited domestic grocers as one example. UK retailers are already benefiting from consolidation and will also be less affected by falls in the pound than German-owned local competitors, like Aldi and Lidl, given they import less of their goods.\n\u0093We don\u0092t believe you need to have a crystal ball about Brexit, or anything else, to be able to invest in the UK,\u0094 Sauerbronn said.\nFor others, the plan is hold off and begin protecting portfolios nearer the March withdrawal date if negotiations break down further.\nRoger Webb, a bond fund manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, has reduced risk in UK credit portfolios. But he isn\u0092t considering further defensive moves, such as selling sterling or reducing exposure to UK banks, until later in the year.\nBritain does have some fans. That is not least because UK equities are now valued below their historic average, according to estimates from Allianz Global Investors.\nGraham Neilson, investment director at Fulcrum Asset Management, has been holding a long sterling position against the euro since August. He is also slightly short on UK government bonds, saying that yields on gilts would move higher if an orderly Brexit allows the Bank of England to raise interest rates.\n\u0093If the market prices in an overly negative outcome and investors become very short on sterling again, we would prefer to go against that,\u0094 Neilson said.", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": "", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Latin American Herald Tribune - Welcome", "site": "laht.com", "site_categories": ["media", "travel", "south_america"], "site_full": "www.laht.com", "site_section": "http://www.laht.com/", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.005, "title": "As Brexit Drags On, Investors Seek More Protection", "title_full": "Latin American Herald Tribune - As Brexit Drags On, Investors Seek More Protection", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8eaaCRQb3RO.9kQ4RsndpTEQSOCb.1W4Dk43DVx9vsDwk2VZ.H5H3NwwnvAplNLIh6gFjXxoMxPmwaSwKo9Own", "uuid": "ba70c8abbd850290c245e7bffe5879cf92a9f308"}, "title": "As Brexit Drags On, Investors Seek More Protection", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8eaaCRQb3RO.9kQ4RsndpTEQSOCb.1W4Dk43DVx9vsDwk2VZ.H5H3NwwnvAplNLIh6gFjXxoMxPmwaSwKo9Own", "uuid": "ba70c8abbd850290c245e7bffe5879cf92a9f308"}, {"author": "NAOMI CANTON", "crawled": "2018-10-21T04:30:12.001+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ubs ag", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rose capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose capital ventures ltd", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "vijay mallya", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sidhartha mallya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mallya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gladco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lalitha mallya", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "Swiss bank UBS AG is seeking to evict indebted ex-Kingfisher tycoon Vijay Mallya , his mother and son from their swish multi-million-pound mansion overlooking Regent\u2019s Park in London. The bank has applied for possession of the property in the UK High Court, the country\u2019s third highest court, on grounds that the mortgage has expired and not been repaid.\nUBS\u2019s claim against Rose Capital Ventures Ltd, Vijay Mallya, mother Lalitha Mallya and son Sidhartha Mallya, in the business and property court of the High Court, will be heard on October 24. Rose Capital Ventures Ltd took out a five-year interest only mortgage on the property with UBS in March 2012 for \u00a320.4 million (Rs 195 crore).\nMallya, his mother and son live here and are beneficiaries of the trust, UBS states. The shares in Rose Capital are owned by Gladco that is owned by the Sileta trust, a Mallya family trust, Mallya confirms in his defence. Despite the loan\u2019s expiry and the claimant\u2019s request that defendants vacate the property, the defendants have refused to move out, UBS states in its claim.\nThe leasehold property \u2014 18 and 19 Cornwall Terrace \u2014 was purchased by Rose Capital and incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on October 3, 2005, for \u00a35.4 million (Rs 52 crore). Freehold rights to the property belong to the Crown Estate, namely the Queen, as per the title deeds.\nUBS also seeks Rose Capital pay the loan\u2019s outstanding and wants the court to declare that the defendants are not entitled to enter or remain on the property. The amount owed as of September 1, 2017, is \u00a320,718,236 (Rs 198 crore), the bank has alleged.\nThe claim states that UBS terminated the loan early on June 9, 2016. Since the loan was not repaid, the bank appointed receivers who started proceedings against the four defendants and housekeeper for the property\u2019s possession in November 2016. Following a June 2017 court order, the housekeeper vacated, UBS states.\nSince the mortgage expired on March 26, 2017, and the outstanding balance on that date of \u00a320.4 million was still not paid, the proceedings by the receiver were stayed, and the bank decided to bring proceedings to take possession of the property and to sell it, UBS states. An attempt to refinance the loan with CBH Bank by Rose Capital collapsed and \u201cas far as the claimant knows, there are no other potential refinancing options for Rose Capital,\u201d the claim states.\nBarrister Jonathan Gavaghan, of Blake Morgan LLP representing the defendants, denies that UBS has the right to the property. They state Rose Capital had continued to make the interest payments as required and that UBS has not given any legitimate reason for calling in the debt early. They have called UBS\u2019s claim a breach of mortgage terms.\nGavaghan said Mallya had been \u201corally assured\u201d by Gautam Kumar at UBS that the loan would be \u201crolled over on the expiry of the five-year term\u201d and \u201cextended to at least a 10-year period\u201d and that Rose Capital took the loan basis this.

She wears a white pith helmet in Kenya to warn China about its colonial ambitions for Africa, and a white fedora in front of a pyramid to declare war on the cabal.\u201d\u201d\nThe fall of the Zionist house of Saud plus possible coup attempt in Russia By Benjamin Fulford, White Dragon Society, October 15, 2018\nWorld events are quickly coming to a head, with a major move against the house of Saud and a possible coup attempt this weekend against Russian President Vladimir Putin, say Pentagon, CIA, and FSB sources. First, the murder (or psy-ops staged murder) of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi is part of a move to remove the Zionist/Satanic house of Saud from control of Saudi Arabia and Middle Eastern oil, according to Pentagon and CIA sources. The operation is also aimed at grabbing funds to keep the bankrupt U.S. afloat, CIA sources say.\nThis is how the CIA summed up the situation:\n\u201cThe U.S. Treasury is holding between $3-5 TRILLION of Saudi Arabia\u2019s petrodollars, which have been accumulating since the 70\u2019s when this whole petrodollar sleight of hand began (around the same time that Nixon closed the gold window). These trillions have been confiscated and will not be returned. The same for the thousands of tons of gold stored in Credit Suisse and UBS banks in Switzerland, which was owned by Saudi Arabia (the House of Saud). It has been confiscated as well. It is game over financially for the Zionist Khazarian House of Saud. This really is Game-Set-Match.\u201d\nIt is also no coincidence the Khashoggi incident happened just as the head of the CIA in Turkey, \u201cPastor\u201d Andrew Brunson, was released from Turkish prison. The longer-term scenario will be for Turkey to resume control of its former holdings in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, while Israel becomes a Jewish autonomous zone under Turkish protection, the sources say.\nAs a preliminary step, \u201cSaudi clown prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) may be purged, as Saudi Arabia is facing Western sanctions and boycotts in a dry run for an attack on Israel when 9/11 documents are declassified,\u201d Pentagon sources add.\nWe will discuss this further below, but as this newsletter was about to be published we got urgent communications from FSB sources about an attempted coup this weekend against Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the sources, a big move against the autonomous Donbass region of the Ukraine by \u201cRothschild forces\u201d led to a \u201chuge dispute inside the Russian general staff with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu\u2026\n\u2026backing former FSB head and Secretary of the Security Council of Russia Nikolai Patrushev as the new Russian leader,\u201d the sources say. However, Putin was evacuated from Moscow, supported by \u201cthree patriotic generals,\u201d and the coup was averted with the help of Russian special forces, the sources say.\nThis preliminary intelligence may be linked to the following report from CIA sources claiming that \u201cvarious world leaders have been called to Russia for a meeting with Putin but no one came from the USA. They were not allowed any representation whatsoever. What is Putin planning with the rest of the world leaders?\u201d\nThe reported coup attempt coincides with a sudden upsurge of fighting in the Eastern Ukraine, as reported by multiple regional news outlets. https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/volker-says-russia-continues-to-fuel-fighting-in-eastern-ukraine.html\nThe Russian sources say a landing by 5,000 troops along the border of the Eastern Ukraine and Russia was repelled. The fighting in the Ukraine was part of an attempt to provoke a NATO attack on Russia to distract Russian attention from the coup attempt. We have contacted White Dragon Society FSB sources for further confirmation, but none has been received as this newsletter went public. We will provide emergency updates as required.\nIn any case, the Rothschilds may have tried to overthrow Putin as a result of the dire situation facing their slave colony Israel. Here, satan-worshiping Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under attack on multiple fronts. His wife, Sara Netanyahu, began her criminal trial on charges of fraud on Sunday. Benyamin Netanyahu has been questioned by police twelve times related to various fraud investigations and is expected to be arrested soon, Mossad sources say. https://www.reuters.com/article/U.S.-israel-netanyahu-wife/wife-of-israeli-prime-minister-goes-on-trial-for-fraud-idUSKCN1MH0IJ?utm_source=reddit.com\nFurthermore, \u201cU.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley resigned because of the corruption charges that she herself will be charged with for her part in Benjamin and Sara Netanyahu\u2019s fraud cases,\u201d CIA sources say. \u201cIt seems that she will be charged very soon with corruption for diverting $20 million of U.S. Aid funds that were earmarked for helping the Palestinian people. We both know that U.S. Aid is a CIA front organization,\u201d they say.\nThis is how Pentagon sources summed up the situation: \u201cThe purge begins with Israeli stooge Nikki Haley being booted off the UN, whose departure is long overdue, while her preferred replacement globalist Goldmanite Dina Powell is rejected.\u201d\nThe Russian troops using electronic warfare in Syria have also shut down all Israeli Air Force activities, as reported by the Mossad-linked site Debka.", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": "https://kauilapele.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/benjamin_fulford_in_canoe_361.jpg", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-18T13:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Kauilapele's Blog", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "site_full": "kauilapele.wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://kauilapele.wordpress.com/feed/", "site_type": "blogs", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "FULL ARTICLE Benjamin Fulford 10-15-18\u2026 \u201cThe fall of the Zionist house of Saud plus possible coup attempt in Russia\u201d", "title_full": "FULL ARTICLE Benjamin Fulford 10-15-18\u2026 \u201cThe fall of the Zionist house of Saud plus possible coup attempt in Russia\u201d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTp6KANChdOM7w39p1wxeC4Wewt.x52cYcjpuAZ.cvAaxbwFd3ncX.QljdNicn4Lj2sSsyIq13X3Xb1ZkKB6EzQvekl555EQT82Y3uERyJmA6jewgNjHQuBDq1sO0fMA12Gzi21DQMG3W.P6Mr_yZ4X8GhuhJuLwxJEZJmet47eeJ4F7POGYbhKtvog3._kOwXGsEClbO2wqQ--", "uuid": "15e5769ea9d3aa370c81e798369d6ebb5c8e2698"}, "title": "FULL ARTICLE Benjamin Fulford 10-15-18\u2026 \u201cThe fall of the Zionist house of Saud plus possible coup attempt in Russia\u201d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTp6KANChdOM7w39p1wxeC4Wewt.x52cYcjpuAZ.cvAaxbwFd3ncX.QljdNicn4Lj2sSsyIq13X3Xb1ZkKB6EzQvekl555EQT82Y3uERyJmA6jewgNjHQuBDq1sO0fMA12Gzi21DQMG3W.P6Mr_yZ4X8GhuhJuLwxJEZJmet47eeJ4F7POGYbhKtvog3._kOwXGsEClbO2wqQ--", "uuid": "15e5769ea9d3aa370c81e798369d6ebb5c8e2698"}, {"author": "", "crawled": "2018-10-21T05:54:44.003+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [], "organizations": [{"name": "arcelormittal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cowen & co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macquarie research", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "matthew", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard arcelormittal", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "Here\u2019s how analysts see ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) after this past week.\nOctober 19, 2018 - By Matthew Richard ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) Ratings Coverage\nAmong 3 analysts covering ArcelorMittal ( NYSE:MT ), 1 have Buy rating, 1 Sell and 1 Hold.

their entitlement of the property. Updated: October 21, 2018, 8:27 AM IST File photo of Vijay Mallya. (Getty Images) Loading... New Delhi: Fugitive Vijay Mallya, along with his mother and son, may soon be evicted from his swish multi-million-pound mansion overlooking Regent\u2019s Park in London. The Swiss bank has applied for the possession of the mansion in UK High Court citing that the mortgage has not been repaid. The bank\u2019s claim against Rose Capital Ventures Ltd, Vijay Mallya, mother Lalitha Mallya and son Sidhartha Mallya, in the business and property court of the High Court, will be heard on October 24, the Times of India reported. In 2012, the Rose Capital Ventures Ltd took out a five-year interest only mortgage on the mansion with UBS for \u00a320.4 million (Rs 195 crore). The mortgage has expired. In his defence, Mallya has said that the shares in Rose Capital are owned by Gladco, which is owned by the Mallya family trust, Sileta trust. According to UBS, Mallya, his mother and son are the beneficiaries of the trust and live in the mansion. In its statement, the UBS has said that the defendants have refused to vacate the property, despite the mortgage expiry in March 2017. The property was purchased by Rose Capital and incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on October 3, 2005, for \u00a35.4 million (Rs 52 crore). UBS has demanded that the loan be repaid and the defendants be evicted from the property, nullifying their entitlement of the property. The amount owed as of September 1, 2017, is \u00a320,718,236 (Rs 198 crore), the bank has claimed. It also states that UBS terminated the loan early on June 9, 2016. The bank appointed receivers who started proceedings against the four defendants and housekeeper for the property\u2019s possession in November 2016 as the loan was not repaid. The housekeeper vacated in June 2017 following a court order, according to Times of India. Despite the mortgage expiry on March 26, 2017, the outstanding balance on that date of \u00a320.4 million was still not paid. The proceedings by the receiver were stayed, and the bank decided to bring proceedings to take possession of the property and to sell it, UBS states. \u200b", "thread": {"country": "IN", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2016/04/vijay_mallya_apr24.jpg", "participants_count": 0, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Top India News- News18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/india.xml", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Vijay Mallya May Soon Lose Possession of His Multi-Million Pound Mansion in London", "title_full": "Vijay Mallya May Soon Lose Possession of His Multi-Million Pound Mansion in London", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC0UF10ckZDEy9r11shw9fgPdahty6yKu9xP_ZeO4H00EmlWW0omxrtjZXN0QaLHgPS7mpSelyoCfz37ueuezsKm9aLqE2bz1zfOvTKosuy2AvkUPalWNKThqW8PTLTxCAUY0BOls8JByWZ2Zjdsogd6PGW0oNI7xnw--", "uuid": "d8c1bc06c94f0bb2f3e9b0f05a26109be3cbd42d"}, "title": "Vijay Mallya May Soon Lose Possession of His Multi-Million Pound Mansion in London", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRSwGm5NuIQC0UF10ckZDEy9r11shw9fgPdahty6yKu9xP_ZeO4H00EmlWW0omxrtjZXN0QaLHgPS7mpSelyoCfz37ueuezsKm9aLqE2bz1zfOvTKosuy2AvkUPalWNKThqW8PTLTxCAUY0BOls8JByWZ2Zjdsogd6PGW0oNI7xnw--", "uuid": "d8c1bc06c94f0bb2f3e9b0f05a26109be3cbd42d"}, {"author": "younews", "crawled": "2018-10-21T08:16:30.000+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "times of india the times of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose capital ventures ltd", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "vija", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vijay mallya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sidhartha mallya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mallya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lalitha mallya", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-21T07:35:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "The Times of India reports: Swiss bank UBS AG is seeking to evict indebted ex-Kingfisher tycoon Vijay Mallya, his mother and son from their swish multi-million-pound mansion overlooking Regent's Park in London.

Embattled tycoon Vijay Mallya might lose swanky London mansion Mallya, his mother Lalitha Mallya and son, Siddhartha Mallya might soon have to leave their Regent Park facing London home. Close Are bad times awaiting the \u201cKing of good times\u201d?\nTrouble seems to be mounting for liquor baron Vijay Mallya who not only had to give up six of his fancy cars but is also on the verge of losing his London mansion. The former Kingfisher boss is bound to get an eviction notice from the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) AG following his failure to pay back the loan on his London property worth Rs 52 crore in 2005.\nApart from Mallya, his mother Lalitha Mallya and son Siddhartha Mallya might also have to leave the Regent Park facing London home soon.\nUBS AG has applied for possession of the property after citing the mortgage was not paid. The bank has filed the application at the UK high court and the hearing for the case is set for October 24. Vijay Mallya has issued a statement on loan default charges. Reuters\nAccording to the Times of India , the Swiss bank has filed the case against Rose Capital Ventures (RCV), Vijay Mallya, Siddhartha Mallya, and Lalitha Mallya.\nThe bank wants Rose Capital to pay the outstanding loan and the defendants' ownership of the property to be nullified which will not allow them to enter or remain on the property.\nRose Capital Ventures had bought the property in 2005 for Rs 52 crore and incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. However, in 2012, a mortgage was taken on the property for \u00a320.4 million or Rs 195 crore which RCV has failed to repay.\nUBS said that even though the mortgage expired in March 2017, the defendants had failed to repay the loan and have not vacated the property even after many notices by the claimants.\nUBS had terminated the loan in June 2016. As of September 2017, Rose Capital Ventures owes \u00a320,78,236 or Rs 198 crore to UBS.\nThe bank had also started appointing receivers to start the proceedings against the defendants and the housekeeper of the property, Times of India reports. The housekeeper vacated the property in June 2017.\nUBS further claimed that Rose Capital attempted to finance the loan with the help of another Swiss Bank, Compagnie Bancaire Helv\u00e9tique. However, that plan also fell through.

It is the first licensed [1] and regulated bank ready to provide secure, consistent and scalable banking to the under-serviced cryptocurrency sector, which currently has a market capitalisation of US$210bn [2] . This is why EQIBank is currently working with four of the top ten largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world to open accounts in December.\n\"The inability to bank cryptocurrency is probably the major challenge facing cryptocurrency exchanges globally with bank accounts constantly being denied or shut down for compliance reasons. EQIBank solves this problem by allowing exchanges and their clients to transact in cryptocurrency and national currency within the one regulatory and technology system in accordance with global banking compliance standards. It is a breakthrough for the blockchain industry as it provides banking certainty for businesses that involve blockchain and cryptocurrencies,\" said Sam Lee , Founder and CEO of Blockchain Global.\n\"GMEX Group delivers the technology behind innovative exchanges and digital asset trading platforms across the globe. We are proud to be recognised as one of the powerhouses of the blockchain economy. However, the well-documented challenges around banking cryptocurrency are proving a major roadblock in this space, preventing blockchain from fulfiling its potential. EQIBank has made great strides in tackling this problem, allowing exchanges, businesses and individuals to bank in cyrpto and national currency - that's why MINDEX our gold exchange initiative and our other exchange ventures across the globe will be using EQIBank,\" said Hirander Misra CEO of GMEX Group and Chairman of MINDEX.\nThe opportunity is huge for a new breed of bank\nExisting global banks hold over $143.75 trillion in assets [3] but are burdened by legacy systems and cumbersome organisational structures. Their lack of flexibility is a key reason that challenger banks have gained such momentum. EQIBank is the first offshore challenger bank in the world - and technology sits at the core of its proposition, using cloud computing, digital services and blockchain technology to bridge the worlds of cryptocurrency and banking.\n\"Existing and new global clients are not adequately serviced by the current antiquated banking structure. Many regional and global banks have merely not scaled to meet the requirements of innovative industries like blockchain. The services of EQIBank are in huge demand by our Law Firm and clients. We hope to open as many as 1000 client accounts a month via our Foreign Direct Division of Yingke, Corporation China.\" said Marco Pearman-Parish , President, Yingke Global - China's largest law firm [4] .\nEQIBank anticipates a huge level of success is because it is unique in addressing the needs of many additional high-value markets:\nThe global bank of choice for hedge funds: EQIBank launched offshore where 85% of the world's hedge funds are domiciled [5] meaning that it is perfectly positioned to be the first choice for the fund industry\nHigh-net-worth individuals : The global volume of net investable assets of high-net-worth individuals is expected to increase by around 25% to almost US$70 trillion by 2021 [6] but challenger banks are simply not focused on this space. This is where EQI has a unique proposition to enable this market to manage national and crypto assets in a single banking relationship\nDigital custody : The four largest global custody banks hold more than $91 trillion in assets under custody and administration [7] .

The bank has applied for possession of the property in the UK High Court, the country\u2019s third highest court, on grounds that the mortgage has expired and not been repaid. UBS\u2019s claim against Rose Capital Ventures Ltd, Vijay Mallya, mother Lalitha Mallya and son Sidhartha Mallya, in the business and property court of the High Court, will be heard on October 24. Rose Capital Ventures Ltd took out a five-year interest only mortgage on the property with UBS in March 2012 for \u00a320.4 million (Rs 195 crore). Mallya, his mother and son live here and are beneficiaries of the trust, UBS states. The shares in Rose Capital are owned by Gladco that is owned by the Sileta trust, a Mallya family trust, Mallya confirms in his defence. Despite the loan\u2019s expiry and the claimant\u2019s request that defendants vacate the property, the defendants have refused to move out, UBS states in its claim.The leasehold property \u2014 18 and 19 Cornwall Terrace \u2014 was purchased by Rose Capital and incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on October 3, 2005, for \u00a35.4 million (Rs 52 crore). Freehold rights to the property belong to the Crown Estate, namely the Queen, as per the title deeds. UBS also seeks Rose Capital pay the loan\u2019s outstanding and wants the court to declare that the defendants are not entitled to enter or remain on the property. The amount owed as of September 1, 2017, is \u00a320,718,236 (Rs 198 crore), the bank has alleged. The claim states that UBS terminated the loan early on June 9, 2016. Since the loan was not repaid, the bank appointed receivers who started proceedings against the four defendants and housekeeper for the property\u2019s possession in November 2016. Following a June 2017 court order, the housekeeper vacated, UBS states. Since the mortgage expired on March 26, 2017, and the outstanding balance on that date of \u00a320.4 million was still not paid, the proceedings by the receiver were stayed, and the bank decided to bring proceedings to take possession of the property and to sell it, UBS states. An attempt to refinance the loan with CBH Bank by Rose Capital collapsed and \u201cas far as the claimant knows, there are no other potential refinancing options for Rose Capital,\u201d the claim states. Barrister Jonathan Gavaghan, of Blake Morgan LLP representing the defendants, denies that UBS has the right to the property. They state Rose Capital had continued to make the interest payments as required and that UBS has not given any legitimate reason for calling in the debt early. They have called UBS\u2019s claim a breach of mortgage terms. Gavaghan said Mallya had been \u201corally assured\u201d by Gautam Kumar at UBS that the loan would be \u201crolled over on the expiry of the five-year term\u201d and \u201cextended to at least a 10-year period\u201d and that Rose Capital took the loan basis this. He also said bringing this claim while the other claim was stayed was \u201cabuse of process\u201d and UBS had \u201cdelayed or obstructed\u201d the refinancing for the property. The HC has subsequently issued an order stating that \u201cBlake Morgan LLP has ceased to act as the solicitors for the defendants\u201d and \u201cthe court record shall show that the defendants now act in person.\u201d A five-day trial is scheduled for May 2019.", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": "", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published":

The travel restrictions have only affected those bankers who help manage money for clients and haven\u2019t been imposed on the securities unit.\nIt was unclear under what circumstances the Singapore-based employee was detained and whether the person has been released.\nAs part of Beijing's ongoing anti-corruption campaign, government clampdowns and unexplained absences have unsettled executives with operations in China, where even the president Interpol recently disappeared abruptly as a result of a bizarre detention. As reported previously, Meng Hongwei was reported missing this month after being taken into custody upon his arrival from France.\n\u201cChina\u2019s deep into an anti-corruption drive as well as effort to deleverage the economy,\" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"\nChina has been a major new market for financial firms such as UBS as the share of world\u2019s wealthy has soared in the region. UBS estimates a new billionaire is minted in China every two days and Credit Suisse this week said China\u2019s total wealth has risen 1,300 percent this century to $51.9 trillion, more than double the rate of any other nation. The number of High Net Worth individuals in Asia-Pac recently surpassed that of North America, and at 6.2 million was the highest of any geographic region in the world.\nTaking advantage of foreign interest in its capital, China has thrown open its financial markets to foreign firms, a move that has given global companies unprecedented access to the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, even as crackdowns on foreign professionals have been on the rise.\nAs for UBS, the world's largest wealth manager has a long history in China and, according to Bloomberg, claims to have been the first Swiss-based bank to establish a presence in the Asia Pacific region in 1964. The Swiss lender is in talks to acquire a majority stake in its Chinese securities joint venture. UBS is also the largest wealth manager in Asia, with total assets under management of $383 billion at the end of last year.\nIt now remains to be seen if the detained UBS banker was actually guilty of a crime, and if not, whether the Zurich-based bank will forget all about the incident in hopes of further profit upside, or if it will demand fair treatment for its employees at the risk of angering local authorities and having its charter removed for making a big fuss. Considering that UBS has yet to officially confirm this incident ever took place - a UBS spokesman declined to comment on the ban and detention - and Bloomberg had to report about it using \"anonymous sources\", it is pretty clear which way the bank is leaning.

Louie Douvis Anthony Macdonald\nWoolworths chairman Gordon Cairns and chief executive Brad Banducci seem intent on shrinking the company to greatness.\nThe pair are set to make a decision by the end of the month on whether to sell or list the $2 billion-odd petrol business . Street Talk understands they will then set their sights on a potential demerger of the liquor, hotels and gaming businesses \u2013 Endeavour Drinks and 75 per cent owned ALH.\nSources said investment banks UBS and CIti were working through various scenarios, as previously reported by this column . And while a decision had not been made, if Woolies has something to get off its chest it would make sense to do it at the company's annual general meeting, which is scheduled for November 21.\nAnd while bankers have the board's ear thanks to the petrol sale, you can be sure they would be keen to add their 2 cents worth about liquor.\nWoolworths has previously played down speculation that it would spin off not just ALH into a separately listed company but that its $8 billion Endeavour Drinks unit, which owns Dan Murphy's and BWS, would also be part of the demerger Advertisement View all announcements\nHowever, it seems to have softened its stance.\n\"Our focus right now is the sale or IPO of the Woolworths Petrol business,\" a Woolworths spokesperson told Street Talk on Sunday.\n\"We continually monitor options for all our portfolio businesses, but right now when it comes to liquor and ALH it's business as usual.\"\nIt is understandable while Woolworths would want to divest ALH because of the reputational damage caused by gaming. Woolworths is the biggest pokies owner in the country and without fail is subject to criticism from shareholders at every AGM.\nBut why it would want to sell its retail liquor arm which is a market leader and a successful business is an interesting question.\nOf course regulators in the various states will also want to have their say. In some states, bottle shop and hotel licences come hand-in-hand, which makes it hard to own one and not the other. Woolworths is understood to be watching Coles closely as it navigates a pubs deal of its own. And in Coles' case, it is expected to keep the bottle shops.\nIf successful, it would create a retail liquor/hotels/gaming powerhouse with earnings (EBITDA) of between $900 million and $1 billion a year and a potential market value of $9 billion.\nThe rationale is similar to Wesfarmers' decision to demerge Coles, which is being driven by chief executive Rob Scott's desire to invest in businesses that can produce higher returns on capital\nEndeavour Drinks was once one of Woolworths' fastest growing businesses, but now that it has almost 50 per cent of the retail liquor market, growth is becoming harder to achieve and earnings growth has slowed, with EBIT rising only 2.8 per cent in 2018.\nEndeavour Drinks is a strong business but return on funds employed of 17.1 per cent is a fraction of that in the Woolworths' Australian supermarkets division \u2013 a staggering 171 per cent \u2013 and similar to that at ALH.

BusinessToday.In 21, 2018 | 00:00 IST\nSwiss Bank UBS AG has moved the UK High Court to evict ex-Kingfisher Airlines boss Vijay Mallya, his mother and son from their multi-million-pound mansion in London. The bank has appealed for possession of the mansion overlooking Regent's Park on grounds that the mortgage has expired and not been repaid, according to a report by The Times of India. The court will now hear the matter on October 24.\nUBS has made the claim in business and property court of the UK High Court against defendants Rose Capital Ventures Ltd, a British Virgin Islands-based company owned by a Mallya family trust, Vijay Mallya, his mother Lalitha Mallya and son Sidhartha Mallya, the report said. Rose Capital Ventures took out a five-year interest only mortgage from UBS on the mansion - 18 and 19 Cornwall Terrace - for 20.4 million pounds (Rs 195 crore) back in March 2012.\nThe shares in Rose Capital are owned by Gladco, which is owned by the Sileta trust, a Mallya family trust, according to information which UBS attributes to Vijay Mallya. His mother and son live in the mansion and are also the beneficiaries of this trust. Rose Capital had bought the property and incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on October 3, 20005 for 5.4 million pounds (Rs 52 crore), as per the TOI report. According to the title deeds, freehold rights to the property lies with Crown Estate, namely the Queen.\nIn its claim, UBS has stated that the defendants have refused to vacate the property despite the loan's expiry and its requests in this regard. The Swiss bank wants the court to declare that the defendants, Mallya and his family members, are not entitled to enter or stay on the property.\nUBS has also requested that Rose Capital pays the outstanding amount of the loan, which as on September 1, 2017, amounts to 20.718,236 (Rs 198 crore) as per the bank's claims. In its claim, UBS said that it terminated the loan early on June 9, 2016, and since it was not repaid, the bank appointed two receivers who initiated proceedings against the four defendants and the housekeeper for the property's possession in November 2016. The housekeeper vacated after a court order in June, 2017.", "thread": {"country": "IN", "domain_rank": 11122, "main_image": "https://smedia2.intoday.in/btmt/images/stories/vijay-mallya-eviction-505_102118065140.jpg", "participants_count": 0, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-21T16:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Business Today| BIZ WRAP", "site": "businesstoday.in", "site_categories": ["media"], "site_full": "www.businesstoday.in", "site_section": "http://www.businesstoday.in/rss/rssstory.jsp?sid=100", "site_type": "blogs", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Swiss bank moves court to evict Vijay Mallya from mortgaged London mansion", "title_full": "Swiss bank moves court to evict Vijay Mallya from mortgaged London mansion", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRrQMwA9kyMdECN6ydOKXLqa5c2esDdn_cTA.8PKS1y22HPnIKSYn1C4U6BTG5zpyuWD5bxVfMrM34FAeuGE3mxv02jgN3PCIPSYd7a6GxRFXksBeU8irgOI_Ui9PSyXVd_A0LDc.TgRZtMHDcHaDY.DqSIuJE_NkegPbvVfTWxWpos_jXI6TMNd8PeAEJlIm4-", "uuid": "5b53c3a407ce91ba505ffd5979b8e942a71f5b05"}, "title": "Swiss bank moves court to evict Vijay Mallya from mortgaged London mansion", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRrQMwA9kyMdECN6ydOKXLqa5c2esDdn_cTA.8PKS1y22HPnIKSYn1C4U6BTG5zpyuWD5bxVfMrM34FAeuGE3mxv02jgN3PCIPSYd7a6GxRFXksBeU8irgOI_Ui9PSyXVd_A0LDc.TgRZtMHDcHaDY.DqSIuJE_NkegPbvVfTWxWpos_jXI6TMNd8PeAEJlIm4-", "uuid": "5b53c3a407ce91ba505ffd5979b8e942a71f5b05"}, {"author": "", "crawled": "2018-10-22T00:20:50.005+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [], "organizations": [{"name": "electrocomponents", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "numis securities", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "downey electrocomponents", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberum capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "electrocomponents plc", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "berenberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peel hunt", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "Analysts take a look at Electrocomponents plc (LON:ECM) having this to say.\nOctober 20, 2018 - By Margaret Downey Electrocomponents plc (LON:ECM) Ratings Coverage\nAmong 8 analysts covering Electrocomponents PLC ( LON:ECM ), 2 have Buy rating, 1 Sell and 5 Hold.

The operation is also aimed at grabbing funds to keep the bankrupt U.S. afloat, CIA sources say.\nThis is how the CIA summed up the situation:\n\u201cThe U.S. Treasury is holding between $3-5 TRILLION of Saudi Arabia\u2019s petrodollars, which have been accumulating since the 70\u2019s when this whole petrodollar sleight of hand began (around the same time that Nixon closed the gold window). These trillions have been confiscated and will not be returned. The same for the thousands of tons of gold stored in Credit Suisse and UBS banks in Switzerland, which was owned by Saudi Arabia (the House of Saud). It has been confiscated as well. It is game over financially for the Zionist Khazarian House of Saud. This really is Game-Set-Match.\u201d\nIt is also no coincidence the Khashoggi incident happened just as the head of the CIA in Turkey, \u201cPastor\u201d Andrew Brunson, was released from Turkish prison. The longer-term scenario will be for Turkey to resume control of its former holdings in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States, while Israel becomes a Jewish autonomous zone under Turkish protection, the sources say.\nAs a preliminary step, \u201cSaudi clown prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) may be purged, as Saudi Arabia is facing Western sanctions and boycotts in a dry run for an attack on Israel when 9/11 documents are declassified,\u201d Pentagon sources add.\nWe will discuss this further below, but as this newsletter was about to be published we got urgent communications from FSB sources about an attempted coup this weekend against Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the sources, a big move against the autonomous Donbass region of the Ukraine by \u201cRothschild forces\u201d led to a \u201chuge dispute inside the Russian general staff with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu\u2026\nThe remainder of this article is only available to members of BenjaminFulford.net Please Log In ( https://benjaminfulford.net/wp-login.php?redirect_to=index.php )or Register ( https://benjaminfulford.net/register/ ) to create an account.\nBenjamin Fulford Weekly Geo-Political News and Analysis, 2018-10-15", "thread": {"country": "NL", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": "http://robscholtemuseum.nl/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Benjamin-Fulford-Weekly-Update-foto-YouTube1.png", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T01:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Rob Scholte Museum", "site": "robscholtemuseum.nl", "site_categories": ["media"], "site_full": "robscholtemuseum.nl", "site_section": "http://robscholtemuseum.nl/feed", "site_type": "blogs", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Benjamin Fulford \u2013 October 15, 2018 + The fall of the Zionist house of Saud plus possible coup attempt in Russia", "title_full": "Benjamin Fulford \u2013 October 15, 2018 + The fall of the Zionist house of Saud plus possible coup attempt in Russia", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmlo_Lar21.hDdtfrelp2L1AShShZKzyC38yAwoPKF5cB7zfBEtZ9haF9cOf.LeuYiLJSjM13EIGROZMijgGXphto0KK3EB_mxSjQEfrVcjuRVbE2fswMWq2BJ7_VzdcbpSiCY4GUR97dMFHHPMQwRzLK.FZyCgD6FcoBWWGLXcw.g--", "uuid": "5f4f14be459ba76096a9c64973147d867f8b6b95"}, "title": "Benjamin Fulford \u2013 October 15, 2018 + The fall of the Zionist house of Saud plus possible coup attempt in Russia", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmlo_Lar21.hDdtfrelp2L1AShShZKzyC38yAwoPKF5cB7zfBEtZ9haF9cOf.LeuYiLJSjM13EIGROZMijgGXphto0KK3EB_mxSjQEfrVcjuRVbE2fswMWq2BJ7_VzdcbpSiCY4GUR97dMFHHPMQwRzLK.FZyCgD6FcoBWWGLXcw.g--", "uuid": "5f4f14be459ba76096a9c64973147d867f8b6b95"}, {"author": "", "crawled": "2018-10-22T02:06:04.009+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nintendo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dlc", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "sheridan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sherican", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric sheridan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": ["https://www.businessinsider.com/ubs-report-is-bullish-on-2018-holiday-video-game-sales-from-activision-2018-10"], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T01:50:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "Random Article Blend\nGaming continues to blossom and bloom when it comes to sales figures. In fact, early consumer trends and feedback have some analysts predicting that the 2018 holiday season will be one where video games totally dominate. Which means there's big business ahead for Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo.\nUBS analyst Eric Sheridan stated in a recent report (via Business Insider ) that gamers are expected to spend big bucks on premium editions of top-name games such as Red Dead Redemption 2 . As well, Sherican expects for loads of money to rain for a variety of DLC content and in-game microtransactions this fall.\nThe report is based on a survey of 5,000 gamers, aged 18-44, from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and China. Respondents are known to game on PCs, portable devices and home consoles. As well, everyone who got surveyed had played and/or bought a video game within the last six months.\nInterestingly enough, the top AAA title on the charts of consumer interest is not Rockstar Games' highly anticipated Red Dead Redemption 2 . Sheridan's report indicates that Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 actually leads the pack, with 40% of the consumer-buying interest going to latest franchise installment. 37% of consumers said they were somewhat likely to buy Assassin's Creed: Odyssey _this fall, while only 36% mentioned that they were somewhat likely to buy _Red Dead Redemption 2 this fall. (Really, people?)\nFor Call of Duty in particular, those numbers have risen by 17% in year-over-year figures, since last year saw only 23% of gamers reporting they were likely to buy Call of Duty: WW2 . So perhaps while gamers were still future-fatigued, they weren't entirely inclined to head back to World War 2 either. Or maybe it was the addition of the Battle Royale mode in Black Ops 4 that convinced the additional gamers to bite the bullet and pick up a copy of Call of Duty this year.\nWith these numbers in mind, the report indicates that Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 could move around 24 million copies throughout fiscal 2019. That would be up 4 million compared to Call of Duty: WW2 's sales in 2017.\nIt isn't just Call of Duty that's potentially on the receiving end of a bump up in numbers. FIFA 19 has seen a 12% gain in consumer interest, with more people this year willing to purchase the EA Sports outing compared to interest in FIFA 18 last year. The same applies to Madden 19 as well, which saw a 10% increase in consumer interest as compared to Madden 18 .\nThe report also indicates that Activision and EA will move the most units this holiday season. Not only thanks to strong interest in the aforementioned products, but also from excitement about expansion packs like Battle of Azeroth for World of Warcraft .\nIn addition to all this news, more than 50% of the gamers on the survey noted that they had plans on purchasing expansion packs or DLC for the games they buy this year. This fits in line with another recent report that indicated that both Activision and Electronic Arts have seen significant revenue gains over the last six years after focusing more on games-as-a-service as opposed to solely boxed-product sales.\nEven gamers who don't buy DLC this year are still planning on paying premium prices for special edition outings. 39% of gamers who had plans on getting NHL 19 were also looking at purchasing the special edition of the game.\nWhat are you guys planning on snatching up before 2018 comes to a close?

For the week ending Friday, 19th October 2018, FNArena registered no less than 21 upgrades for individual ASX-listed stocks, versus two downgrades only. So which stocks still received downgrades? Actually, there is only one. Jewellery retailer Michael Hill cannot shake off the habit of releasing disappointing market updates and this time yet another tough admission has been met with two downgrades. Both went to Sell, or an equivalent of Sell. Seven out of the 21 upgrades only went as far as Neutral; this still leaves 14 fresh Buy ratings for stocks including CSL, Fairfax Media (2x), Super Retail, Sydney Airport, and Webjet. ERM Power, equally recipient of a fresh Buy rating, sits on top of the week's table for positive revisions to price targets, thanks to offloading its troubled division in the USA. National Storage and St Barbara follow next, but overall percentage changes remain benign. A similar observation applies to the negative side where Fairfax Media's consensus target suffered a -5% setback, followed by Northern Star Resources and James Hardie, but the numbers get quickly to a level hardly worth mentioning. The week's changes to earnings estimates offers more fireworks with Perseus Mining (+72%) on top of the positive ranking, handsomely beating the likes of Northern Star, Steadfast Group, ERM Power, Oil Search, and Whitehaven Coal. The flip side has Galaxy Resources (-41%) on \"top\" (bottom?), followed by Domain Holdings, Evolution Mining, Fairfax Media, Fortescue Metals, and ARB Corp. Apart from macro-economic events, investors have plenty to keep an eye out for in the week(s) ahead, from AGMs, to trading updates, to quarterly reports, to (soon) Australian banks releasing financial results.\nUpgrade\nANSELL LIMITED ((ANN)) Upgrade to Neutral from Underperform by Credit Suisse .B/H/S: 2/6/0\nCredit Suisse observes, since the FY18 result, the share price has fallen -15%, resulting in an upgrade to Neutral from Underperform. The broker now considers the risks balanced and the share price supported by the buyback program, a net cash position and potential for M&A.\nThe broker updates assumptions regarding FX and higher raw material prices, resulting in -3% downgrades to earnings estimates. Target is lowered to $23.50 from $24.00.\nAURIZON HOLDINGS LIMITED ((AZJ)) Upgrade to Outperform from Neutral by Credit Suisse .B/H/S: 2/3/3\nFirst quarter above-rail volumes were down -8%. Credit Suisse lowers coal volumes for FY19 by -3% and reduces coal earnings by -4%. The broker raises FY19 bulk earnings by 8%, believing the company could reach agreement with Linfox to sell the Queensland Intermodal business.\nThe Queensland Competition Authority has indicated it will consider a change to the averaging period for the risk-free rate and, if implemented, this could increase the company's operating earnings by around $20m a year. Credit Suisse upgrades to Outperform from Neutral on valuation and a potentially favourable announcement by the QCA.\nThe company's court case against the Queensland Competition Authority, alleging the former chairman was conflicted, starts on October 22. Credit Suisse reduces the target to $4.50 from $4.60.\nCSL LIMITED ((CSL)) Upgrade to Buy from Neutral by Citi .B/H/S: 3/5/0\nCiti analysts have re-assessed their investment view and forward modeling now that the share price has corrected noticeably in line with rising bond yields.\nWhile the share price target has been reset at $218 from $238 with the added comment this includes some $12 for CSL112, the recommendation has also been upgraded to Buy from Neutral.\nAlso, the analysts highlight at their revised target price, CSL shares will be trading on an FY20 PE of 31x; this compares with the three year average of 28x (still at a historic premium, thus).\nERM POWER LIMITED ((EPW)) Upgrade to Accumulate from Hold by Ord Minnett .B/H/S: 3/0/0\nThe company has signed an agreement to sell its US subsidiary Source Power & Gas to Direct Energy for US$27m, effectively simplifying the investment proposition for investors, say the analysts.\nFor company management, this deal now offers the opportunity to concentrate solely on Australian retailing with Ord Minnett adding the shares look cheap/attractive while offering a history of stable retail margins.\nTarget price lifts to $1.90 from $1.60. Recommendation has been upgraded to Accumulate from Hold. Estimates have been lifted.\nFAIRFAX MEDIA LIMITED ((FXJ)) Upgrade to Outperform from Neutral by Credit Suisse and Upgrade to Buy from Neutral by UBS .B/H/S: 3/1/0\nFurther analysis of the proposed merger with Nine Entertainment suggests to Credit Suisse analysts the deal will be dilutive for Nine shareholders in the first two years and only EPS neutral in year three post the merger.\nThe analysts suggest management will seek additional synergies (read: cost cutting) to the tune of $30m to achieve EPS neutrality.\nAs the analysts believe the merger will go ahead, they have upgraded to Outperform from Neutral. Price target lifts by 5c to 90c.\nFairfax has provided a trading update which was largely in line with UBS estimates. Revenue is tracking around -5% lower year-on-year.\nMeanwhile, a softer trading update from Domain ((DHG)) and a downgrade to guidance caught the broker by surprise. This resulted in a substantial drop in the Fairfax share price. UBS upgrades to Buy from Neutral. Target is reduced to $0.80 from $0.85.\nINSURANCE AUSTRALIA GROUP LIMITED ((IAG)) Upgrade to Outperform from Neutral by Credit Suisse .B/H/S: 2/5/1\nOver the past two years the company's margin in commercial lines has not improved to the extent Credit Suisse had expected, despite premium rate increases. The broker suspects a large part of the reason stems from the exit of the Swann business.\nWith some of the distortions to historical margins now explained, the broker is more comfortable about the guidance set by the company for FY19. Further capital management is also considered likely and Credit Suisse allows for a further $600m, 50:50 special dividend to buyback.\nA pullback in the share price provides an opportunity at an attractive entry point and the broker upgrades to Outperform from Neutral. Target is steady at $7.90. The full story is for FNArena subscribers only.

after authorities there asked one of its bankers to delay her departure from Beijing to meet with local officials, Reuters reports, citing a person familiar with the matter.\nThe banker, who is based in Singapore and works in the relationship management team in UBS\u2019s wealth management unit, still has her passport, but was asked to remain in China and meet with local authority officials next week, the source was quoted as saying.\nThe identity and position of the banker were not known.\nThe purpose of the meeting with authorities is not clear, but the bank has asked others in its China wealth management team to review their travel plans carefully, the report said.\nNo other units in the bank, including back office or asset management teams, have been asked to re-consider existing travel plans.\nUBS is the largest wealth manager operating in Asia, managing assets worth an estimated US$383 billion.\nThe Swiss banking group has been building up its presence in China.\nLast week it moved a step closer to becoming the first bank to take majority ownership of its China joint venture under new rules designed to open up the sector, when two of its current partners put their stakes up for sale.\nAny deal on the stakes will need the approval of Chinese authorities, who are yet to give the green light for the 51 percent shareholding, the report noted.\n\u2013 Contact us at

in health technology (healthtech) is shaping up to be the next big thing for Asia's wealthiest.\nUBS, the largest wealth manager globally, said more high-net-worth and ultra-rich clients are putting money into backing the use of information technology to address efficiency and cost constraints in the provision of health care.\nIn 2016, UBS launched an oncology impact fund with US-based healthcare investment firm MPM Capital, investing in companies undertaking cancer research and treatment. The fund raised US$471 million from wealthy clients, with over half that sum from individuals in the Asia-Pacific.\nThe bank is also expecting to launch a healthtech fund some time around the first quarter of next year.\nUBS considers healthtech a nascent sector, but estimates that the value of markets in the field have already exceeded US$100 billion.\nAgeing populations, rising health care demand and costs support the growth of healthtech in Asia and globally.\nPatricia Quek, UBS Singapore head for the ultra-high-net-worth and global family office for South-east Asia, said: \"Over recent years, rising health care costs have become an increasingly important focus for our clients. The UBS global survey of millionaires revealed the cost of health care as a priority for high-net worth individuals, an increasing number of whom expect to live to 100 years and beyond.\"\nShe was speaking at UBS' Healthcare Summit, organised for wealthy individuals, family offices and corporate leaders in Singapore on Friday.\nParticipants at the summit learned how digital technology can be used to improve efficiency, lower costs and provide better treatment outcomes. For example, diagnostics powered by artificial intelligence can free up doctors' time for more complex cases. UBS is also keeping an eye on the trend of telemedicine, which can lower the cost of care by shifting treatment from hospital settings to patients' homes.\nKelvin Tay, regional chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management said: \"We can use technology to make health care more efficient. The health care industry is one of the least digitalised industries ... and this is despite the fact that it has a lot of data. We believe healthtech as a sector is in its infancy and therefore, is likely to evolve in five to 10 years from what it is now - and a lot of that is invested via venture capital and private investments.\"\nUltra-high net worth investors, defined by UBS as those with investable assets of 50 million Swiss francs (S$69.18 million) or more, prefer direct investments and are gaining exposure to healthtech through private equity investments, Ms Quek said.\nSome investments may be strategic to their businesses, she added.\nIn contrast, high-net-worth clients, those with investable assets of between two million (S$2.77 million) and 50 million Swiss francs, may hold smaller investable amounts and hence, take a more diversified approach.\nAsia's richest are big on healthtech investing also because of its potential to reap positive social impact. UBS has noted a rise in clients' interest in sustainable investments in the Asia-Pacific.\nMs Quek said that UBS' survey among millionaires found that, besides investing in their own health, 87 per cent of Singapore millionaires said they were also interested to help members of society to stay healthy.", "thread": {"country": "SG", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": "", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-20T00:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "News | SGSME.SG", "site": "sgsme.sg", "site_categories": ["media"], "site_full": "www.sgsme.sg", "site_section": "https://www.sgsme.sg/news", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Asia's wealthiest look to healthtech investing", "title_full": "Asia's wealthiest look to healthtech investing | SGSME.SG", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS7AUbbAj0hp4LgUyHs1ADziea380m56bzgGeFj65kIAvMNQ6Zi9ZzkPuoDL50A9yj.9F5RL2Nc.GJJT6ewf14E", "uuid": "42fc4621322c850a532897387c6debb8c81d7be1"}, "title": "Asia's wealthiest look to healthtech investing", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS7AUbbAj0hp4LgUyHs1ADziea380m56bzgGeFj65kIAvMNQ6Zi9ZzkPuoDL50A9yj.9F5RL2Nc.GJJT6ewf14E", "uuid": "42fc4621322c850a532897387c6debb8c81d7be1"}, {"author": "www.4-traders.com", "crawled": "2018-10-22T08:51:21.001+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "food-delivery drones launch uber technologies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman changes asia banking leadership", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbs board cbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sqm-which", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldman sachs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs cautions private bankers on travel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tianqi lithium", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "richard parsons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "strauss zelnick", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "Uber Ambitiously Eyes 2021 for Food-Delivery Drones Launch\nUber Technologies envisions taking to the skies with a fleet of food-delivery drones in as little as three years, an ambitious timeline for a ride-hailing company that would face technical challenges and regulatory hurdles.\nRichard Parsons Steps Down From CBS Board\nCBS interim chairman Richard Parsons is resigning because of health issues.
