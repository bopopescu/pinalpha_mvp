Central bank speech |\nDistinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.\nThank you for having me here today.\nDuring my speech, I will discuss the outlook for the South African economy and the current stance of monetary policy. I will also touch on recent trends in the global economy and the influence that these are having on South Africa. Global economic developments\nGlobal economic developments can increasingly be characterised as asynchronous and risk-prone.\nGrowth in the United States (US) appears to be diverging from that of other advanced economies. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects growth in the eurozone, the United Kingdom (UK) and Japan to be slower in 2018 than in 2017, moderating to 2.0%, 1.4% and 1.1% respectively.1 Meanwhile, US economic growth is forecast to accelerate this year to 2.9% from an already strong level of 2.2% in 2017.

A former top executive had a simple explanation.\nIt was simply for divvying up bonuses \u2013 this is how Patrick de Fayet explained the existence of hand-written notebooks, which were later destroyed. Prosecutors allege that the bank maintained a parallel record on its tax-dodging clients in the ledgers.\nDe Fayets, the former head of UBS' front office in France, was responding to questions by French prosecutors at a trial in Paris, as news agency \u00ab Bloomberg \u00bb reported. He claimed that UBS merely used hand-written records to divvy up bonuses between Swiss and French bankers.\nMoney Feuds\nPrivate bankers were measured on how much in net new funds they routed to their colleagues abroad. Disputes arising from whether the Swiss or French side had earned the bonus necessitated the hand-written notes, de Fayet told the court.\nAs soon as the data was entered into a wider electronic record, the notes were destroyed. Prosecutor Serge Roques , who questioned de Fayet, found this practice troubling.\nWhistleblower St\u00e9phanie Gibaud was the first to report on the hand-written ledgers in a 2014 book. The former marketing manager at UBS in France laid the basis for the prosecution's case against the Swiss bank .\nUBS Couldn't Verify\nDe Fayet was queried on the whether his clients came clean on their tax bill. He said clients had largely kept it to themselves if they had not paid taxes in France.\nUBS itself couldn't verify whether clients did pay taxes, de Fayet said \u2013 the only thing that bankers knew for certainty was that clients who wanted to park their money in Switzerland would be reminded of their tax obligation.

Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan UBS Asset Management, Grocon and JLL will become the country's first major multifamily or built-to-rent apartment operator and developer following the conversion of 1251 apartments in the former Gold Coast Commonwealth Games Athletes village into rental units.\nLaunched on Friday, the $550 million village known as \"Smith Collective\" will offer one to two bedroom apartments and three bedroom townhouses fo rental periods of between 6 months to two years, to be governed as standard leases under the Queensland Residential Tenancies Authority.\nThe land on which the village sits was originally owned by the Queensland government but the whole project has now been sold to a significant investor, held in a trust managed by UBS. While the name of the owner remains confidential, the Abu Dhabi Investment Council has been long said to be associated with the project.\nUBS Asset Management and Grocon completed the Parklands project together late last year and leased it to the Gold Coast 2018 Organising Committee for use as the athletes village for the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Game in April this year.\nGold Coast Commonwealth Games Athletes Village becomes the country's biggest multifamily or build to rent project Tony Moore Following the completion of the games, the 18 apartment towers and 82 townhouses and 6280sq m retail hub were refitted into a housing complex to be open for lease in stages.\nAdvertisement Property group JLL will manage the village as well as handle lease management across all the apartments as a single landlord. They will also be responsible for maintaining the amenities in the village in keeping with the classic features of a build to rent or multifamily project.\nUnlike typical mum and dad rentals, the single landlord structure will allow tenants to benefit from more efficient property management and higher security of tenancy. The build to rent concept, while massive in the US and the UK, has only just started gaining momentum in Australia as housing affordability deteriorates and home ownership becomes increasingly expensive.\nSydney and Melbourne are harder markets to start build to rent projects where land prices are steeper than other parts of the country. Along with expensive taxes, yields for these projects are notoriously low although Mirvac has broken through recently launching Sydney's first mass-scale build to rent tower in the Sydney Olympic Park with its first partner Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) .\nUBS is confident it will be able to lease all 1251 apartments in stages given its location to areas of high employment such as Griffith University, Gold Coast University Hospital and Gold Coast Private Hospital.\nGold Coast's low residential vacancy also means new homes for rent will be in demand, UBS Asset Management executive director Michael Woodrow says.\n\"Our vision is to create a thriving community unlike anything the Gold Coast has seen,\" he said.\n\"By maintaining ownership of Smith Collective's residential offering, we are able to grant those wishes and help our residents and retailers build a sense of community often lost within large-scale urban developments.\"\nRents for one-bedroom apartments start at $380 a week.\nThe Smith Collective, five kilometres from Surfers Paradise, will feature a Woolworths supermarket, boutique retailers, and a dining precinct. It is set on seven hectares of parkland, and will also offer four swimming pools, gyms and fitness areas, a running track and outdoor barbecue areas and rooftop terraces on apartment buildings.\nFree wi-fi service will be offered throughout the community's public spaces.\nThe first residents are expected to move in next year.", "thread": {"country": "AU", "domain_rank": 16906, "main_image": "https://www.afr.com/content/dam/images/h/1/6/v/7/c/image.related.afrArticleLead.620x365.h16v1h.png/1539931920311.jpg", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-18T23:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Financial Review - Business, Finance and Investment News | afr.com", "site": "afr.com", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "site_full": "www.afr.com", "site_section": "https://www.afr.com/", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "UBS, JLL become Australia's biggest residential multifamily operator", "title_full": "UBS, JLL become Australia's biggest residential multifamily operator | afr.com", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSONYI1RbA4j0rdDrsp1dOg0ohvRiZecoIbFpjXaM41fL7WsakBR51hB7e20Gal5NnNAwOBtcHCGkh2K0QmLMFG3LDM1CE._wi1bkkKgHDdOi3DNhrmloGVQygtrjULWGorgRKZXNs.uJ46DpG_VsNeH6c7Gtw3N_8-", "uuid": "d4bef46cbbf51998cc819b86e10cc25f17f1b396"}, "title": "UBS, JLL become Australia's biggest residential multifamily operator", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSONYI1RbA4j0rdDrsp1dOg0ohvRiZecoIbFpjXaM41fL7WsakBR51hB7e20Gal5NnNAwOBtcHCGkh2K0QmLMFG3LDM1CE._wi1bkkKgHDdOi3DNhrmloGVQygtrjULWGorgRKZXNs.uJ46DpG_VsNeH6c7Gtw3N_8-", "uuid": "d4bef46cbbf51998cc819b86e10cc25f17f1b396"}, {"author": "nasdaq.com", "crawled": "2018-10-19T16:26:17.004+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fenics markets", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bgc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bgc partners, inc.", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "global head of electronic & hybrid markets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fenics markets as head of americas product strategy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "electronic & hybrid markets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tabb group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icap", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "david coombs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "anthony perrotta", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "anthony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dean berry", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/bgcpartners", "http://www.bgcpartners.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fenics-markets-adds-david-coombs-and-anthony-perrotta-to-their-product-strategy-division-300721701.html", "http://ir.bgcpartners.com/", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/bgc-partners"], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-19T17:26:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "LONDON, Oct. 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Fenics Markets, a subsidiary of BGC Partners, Inc.

More billionaires hail from the United States than from anywhere else.\nThat will boost the 2.4 billion francsVontobel's own North American-focused Swiss Wealth Advisors now manages.\n\"North America is one of our focus markets in which we intend to achieve above-average growth,\" Georg Schubiger, head of Vontobel Wealth Management, said on Friday.\nThe bank aims to manage 5 billion Swiss francs for U.S. private banking clients, Chief Executive Zeno Staub said.\nUBS, Switzerland's biggest bank and the world's largest wealth manager, has maintained a large U.S. presence even after $780 million in settlements with U.S. authorities over undeclared assets U.S. clients had held with the bank.\nIt books onshore business for North American clients in offices in New York and across the country, accounting for roughly half the bank's wealth management business.\nUBS, like other Swiss money managers, is looking to court U.S. expats as well. After merging its North American and international wealth management businesses this year, it sees opportunities with U.S. customers living and booking money abroad.\nThe bank is expected to announce more details at an investor day on Oct. 25.\nCOMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE\nSize matters now that special regulations from U.S. authorities -- particularly the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and also from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) -- have made offshore business with American customers more complex.\n\"As a rule of thumb, you need about $2 billion in managed assets, which is quite a lot for small banks in a single market,\" Ralph Kreis, director of consulting firm AlixPartners, said.\nBusiness below that threshold is worthwhile only for institutions focusing on a specific segment or particularly profitable customers, he added.\nMany banks have faced challenges in building or rebuilding business with U.S. customers, Kreis said.\nThis has dissuaded major private banks -- including Switzerland's second-biggest, Credit Suisse, and third-largest listed bank, Julius Baer -- from offering wealth management services within the United States.\nWhile the U.S. domestic private banking market is largely dominated by local players like Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo, Swiss banks see lucrative opportunities in courting Americans seeking to do safe business offshore.\nSAFE HAVEN\nVery wealthy individuals tend to diversify their assets over several regions, and Swiss banks see a role in offering tax-compliant investment opportunities in a stable country with a crisis-proof currency.\n\"We offer a safe haven,\" said Vontobel manager Patrice E. Humbel, responsible for the U.S. market.\n\"Two-thirds of our customers have European DNA. They are Germans, Italians, French or Swiss who are first-, second- or third-generation U.S. citizens.\"\nAbove a certain size, banks need a licence from the SEC to be able to offer investment products to U.S. citizens.\n\"In Switzerland, there are about 40 to 50 firms with this licence,\" AlixPartners'Martin Buechel said.\nThat number has roughly doubled over the last four years, said Anne Liebgott, a consultant who provides information for Americans seeking Swiss wealth management services.\nFor practical and regulatory purposes, many banks separate their U.S. business into distinct units that operate independently and offer tailored products.\nGeneva-based private bank Pictet said it now manages $6.2 billion in assets out of its Pictet North America Advisors division, while UBS subsidiary Swiss Financial Advisors said it manages around 5 billion Swiss francs.\n($1 = 0.9957 Swiss francs)", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": 2975, "main_image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/images/dreamit.jpg", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-19T14:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Bank of America Corporation (BAC) News Headlines - NASDAQ.com", "site": "nasdaq.com", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance"], "site_full": "www.nasdaq.com", "site_section": "https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/bac/news-headlines", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Swiss banks court rich Americans a decade after tax drama", "title_full": "Swiss banks court rich Americans a decade after tax drama - Nasdaq.com", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibdhzJFXSBPUC7zqwOJ0a0YOLhjQDxm2pgxJ8SuLtgc6Wuckudzfs907iqxLgTdmR46B9X3d.ZOv3_0w2qVUiTY.HdnWKSR5uZE3DtfsynH.PJM_OJPUHzzO_52pOnfI-", "uuid": "fe1e03433c77a3c529fb3e2f70a36b338768fff6"}, "title": "Swiss banks court rich Americans a decade after tax drama", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQibdhzJFXSBPUC7zqwOJ0a0YOLhjQDxm2pgxJ8SuLtgc6Wuckudzfs907iqxLgTdmR46B9X3d.ZOv3_0w2qVUiTY.HdnWKSR5uZE3DtfsynH.PJM_OJPUHzzO_52pOnfI-", "uuid": "fe1e03433c77a3c529fb3e2f70a36b338768fff6"}, {"author": "Gideone Rosa (noreply@blogger.com)", "crawled": "2018-10-19T16:57:55.029+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [], "organizations": [{"name": "dia da mancha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dia da mancha dia", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": []}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-19T13:37:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "De 22 a 26 de outubro ,\na Prefeitura de Jata\u0102, por meio da sua Secretaria de Sa\u0102\u015fde, realizar\u0102\u0104 a XII Campanha Contra a Hansen\u0102ase.

The Nasdaq composite closed down 0.48% after an earlier rally, and the S&P 500 was mostly flat.\nOvernight, China reported its economy expanded at the slowest pace in a decade during the third quarter.

Jason Draho, head of Americas asset allocation at UBS, said talk of stimulus programs offered markets some comfort.\n\"How much and how soon the stimulus will arrive is uncertain, so far to soon to say this is a turning point,\" he said. \"Good news on China's growth and trade are two catalysts the market needs to see to get more positive on equities.\"\nMeanwhile, some are worried the Federal Reserve could raise borrowing rates at a pace that may become slightly restrictive.

The bailed-out lender is scheduled to report results on Thursday, a day after blue-chip peer Barclays. RBS (LON:RBS) reports on Friday, while Asia-focused HSBC (LON:HSBA) and StanChart (LON:STAN) will follow on October 29 and October 31, respectively.\nLloyds\u2019 share price has fallen deep into the red in today\u2019s session, having given up 1.30 percent to 56.25p as of 13:37 BST.

The FTSE 100 lender is further expected to have generated total income of \u00a34.68 billion for the period, up from \u00a34.62 billion last year.\n\u201cLBG is, in our view, an undervalued, strongly capital generative bank, operating with a cost advantage in a competitive market and with decent medium-term growth opportunities in lending, savings, investments and general insurance,\u201d the broker concluded.

Even if fans can't afford to buy a designer item immediately, their interest will likely mean they purchase \"sooner or later.\"\nGucci, for example, spent around a third of its advertising and promotions budget on digital marketing in 2016, and UBS estimates this will grow to around 55 percent in 2018. This might include advertising on Instagram, as well as fees paid to celebrity endorsers to share sponsored posts.\nUBS also analyzed Gucci's quarterly average likes per Instagram post between the start of 2016 and the second quarter of 2018 and found a 76 percent correlation between the increase in likes and sales growth.\nFacebook -owned Instagram has made it easier for people to purchase from the platform, letting people shop directly from Stories in June and expanding the function to 46 countries on September 17.\nUBS also found a strong link between Google search and organic growth in Italy, Gucci's home country, at 94 percent, when it looked at the brand's quarterly organic sales growth and the year-on-year growth in its three-month average Google searches from 2012 to the second quarter of 2018. This suggests that people want \"instant gratification,\" according to UBS. For LVMH's brands, the correlation is 73 percent over the same period.\nThe \"customer journey,\" from someone browsing social channels to making a purchase, an activity that marketers spend a lot of time tracking, could also be shorter than expected for luxury brands.\nAs well as looking at historical data, UBS analyzed 25 European luxury brands' Instagram accounts over September, known as \"fashion month,\" when designers present their collections on New York, London, Milan and Paris runways for the following spring/summer season, noting that it does not include data for the full Paris fashion week, which ran from September 25 to October 2.\nGucci had 14.5 million likes in September, with an average of 164,200 likes per post, followed by Dior with 9.3 million likes and 63,000 likes per post.\nRolex, meanwhile, had fewer Instagram likes in September (1.1 million), but came second in the likes-per-post measure, with 112,800. Versace got 6.4 million likes, with an average of 626,000 likes per post.\nBurberry , closely-watched because of its debut collection from new creative head Riccardo Tisci, managed an average of 40,500 likes per Instagram post in September, with 2.5 million likes overall.\nFor some brands, millennials account for a high proportion of sales. UBS estimates that 65 percent of Saint Laurent's sales come from millennials, while Gucci and Prada have around 50 percent. Around a third of Louis Vuitton's sales come from millennials, while about 10 to 15 percent of Tod's sales are from this generation.\nUBS looked at total monthly likes, the number of posts, the average likes per post, the number of followers, month-on-month growth in followers and the engagement rate (average number of likes per post divided by the number of followers) for its European Luxury report.

It cost France \u20ac17bn, Italy \u20ac4.5bn, and Denmark \u20ac1.7bn. It also harmed Austria, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, and Spain.\nNews of the problem first came to light in Germany in 2016.\nBut its full scale was exposed by a cross-border investigation, involving 19 media in 12 countries, which consulted more than 180,000 pages of documents, including letters from German prosecutors, and which published its findings on Thursday (18 October).\n\"This is the biggest tax robbery in European history,\" Christoph Spengel, a tax expert at the University of Mannheim in Germany, told German newspaper Zeit.\nThe news comes on the heels of revelations that Denmark's top lender, Danske Bank, perpetrated the biggest money-laundering scandal in European history.\nThe Danish bank funnelled some \u20ac200bn of \"suspicious\" Russian money into other jurisdictions via Estonia, that investigation showed.\nDeutsche Bank previously admitted to handling some \u20ac10bn of illicit Russian trades.\nThe bank sector's disgrace did not stop EU leaders, at a summit in Brussels also on Thursday, from agreeing to go ahead with a banking union.\n\"Everyone is determined to put a package on the table by the December summit that describes the banking union of the future and also says something about the roadmap - i.e. the way to a deposit guarantee and describes progress on the capital markets union,\" German chancellor Angela Merkel said after the meeting.\nThe union would create a more stable regulatory environment, she said.\nBut the Danske Bank scandal has prompted debate on the merits of the EU scheme in Denmark.\nThe money-laundering case \"makes the need to probe what we might get from being in the banking union even stronger,\" Danish finance minister Kristian Jensen said on Friday.\n\"We haven't made up our minds about all the positives and negatives of the banking union yet,\" he said.\nThe opposition Social Democrats party said there was nothing in the EU \"package\" that would prevent the kind of abuses perpetrated by the Danish lender.\n\"Money laundering transcends borders. The Danske Bank scandal is enormous, but in reality it's a symptom of more widespread problems with international money flows,\" the Social Democrats' financial spokesman, Benny Engelbrecht, said.\nThe cum-ex investigation also showed that tax information exchange between EU states did nothing to prevent the multi-billion euro fraud.\nIt disclosed a letter from the prosecutor in Cologne, Germany, to Santander, which said it was suspected of having \"planned and executed trades\" that facilitated \"severe tax evasion\".\nIt also showed that German tax inspectors had raided the homes of Warburg Bank chiefs.\nMost of the banks denied wrongdoing.\n\"In matters of morality, M.M. Warburg & Co ... has no blame,\" it said. Santander said only that it was \"fully cooperating\" with German authorities.\nThe cum-ex scheme was masterminded by Hanno Berger, a former German tax inspector, who now lives in Switzerland.\nHe told the Reuters news agency that he first gave his idea to Australian bank Macqaurie (also involved in the scams), but that the whole trick was based on a legitimate loophole in tax laws.\n\"They [the German state] cannot punish others for their mistakes,\" he said.\n ", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": "https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euobs-media/4611855c07f121bfc7872127259f41a9-480x.jpg", "participants_count": 0, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-19T10:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "News from EUobserver", "site": "euobserver.com", "site_categories": ["politics", "law_government_and_politics", "media"], "site_full": "euobserver.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.euobserver.com/rss/9", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Top EU banks guilty of multi-billion tax fraud", "title_full": "Top EU banks guilty of multi-billion tax fraud", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbJuJ7n4kELdUQZUA8c7FSm.gHp.AvrhZiSceUNn5YwQ--", "uuid": "98adce7fc64d1d7073f7d8ff69b1067974cd08b3"}, "title": "Top EU banks guilty of multi-billion tax fraud", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQbJuJ7n4kELdUQZUA8c7FSm.gHp.AvrhZiSceUNn5YwQ--", "uuid": "98adce7fc64d1d7073f7d8ff69b1067974cd08b3"}, {"author": "finews.com (info@finews.com)", "crawled": "2018-10-19T21:32:37.057+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ubs cuts jobs for china push page", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bcg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "citi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fan bingbing", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "bingbing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "natalie yu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seb dovey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deloitte", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": ["http://image-src.bcg.com/Images/BCG_China-Wealth-2017_ENG_Dec-2017_tcm21-180984.pdf"], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-18T15:53:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "UBS Cuts Jobs for China Push Page 1 of 2\nA $129 million bill for Chinese actress Fan Bingbing for tax evasion has put private banks looking to tap onshore wealth in the country on high alert.\nA host of foreign banks including UBS are ramping up in mainland China, where wealth is expected to grow by more 12 percent annually in coming years.

He cited weak results there over the last 12 months. This, coupled with higher wages in the countries, could lead to margins that are considerably lower than what Alsea is used to, he said.\nInvestors may be signaling their unease with the deal: Alsea\u2019s shares are down 3.5 percent in the last two days. The transaction was announced before the start of trading on Thursday.\nThe restaurant operator, which specializes in bringing U.S. chains such as Domino\u2019s and Burger King to Latin America, is under pressure to maintain its meteoric rise of recent years. The company has expanding across South America and established a European foothold in Spain. Mexico City-based Alsea has posted annual sales growth of more than 10 percent for seven consecutive years.\nThe relationship with Starbucks has been a key driver of that growth: Alsea now operates more than 950 of the coffee giant\u2019s restaurants across Latin America.\nGrupo Finanicero Monex analyst Veronica Uribe Boyzo agreed that the addition of France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg will pressure Alsea\u2019s Ebitda margin -- a measure of profitability after excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. In a research note, she cited Starbucks\u2019 12.5 percent Ebitda margin for Europe, versus Alsea\u2019s 16.1 percent margin for the outlets it operates.\nAlthough Starbucks and Alsea didn\u2019t elaborate on terms, Monex estimates Alsea might raise additional debt in Euros and increase its leverage ratio to 2.44 times from the current 2.06 times.\nTo be sure, the transaction could provide diversification for Alsea, Barclays Plc analyst Benjamin Theurer said.

The travel restrictions have only affected those who help manage money for clients and haven\u2019t been imposed on the securities unit, said the people.\nA spokesman for UBS, Switzerland\u2019s largest bank, declined to comment on the ban and detention.\nUBS has a long history in China and claims to have been the first Swiss-based bank to establish a presence in the Asia Pacific region in 1964. The Swiss lender is in talks to acquire a majority stake in its Chinese securities joint venture and Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti said in January that the bank is ahead on a five-year plan to double headcount in the country.\nIt\u2019s also the largest wealth manager in Asia, with total assets under management of $383 billion at the end of last year, according to Asian Private Banker. Last year, it got a private-funds license in China.\nChina has thrown open its financial markets to foreign firms, a move that has given global companies unprecedented access to the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. Over the past year, the nation has announced reforms that relax foreign ownership limits for lenders, insurers and money managers.\n--With assistance from Jan-Henrik F\u00f6rster.\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Alfred Liu in Hong Kong at aliu226@bloomberg.net;Crystal Tse in Hong Kong at ctse44@bloomberg.net;Patrick Winters in Zurich at pwinters3@bloomberg.net;Vinicy Chan in Hong Kong at vchan91@bloomberg.net;Fion Li in Hong Kong at fli59@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Elisa Martinuzzi at emartinuzzi@bloomberg.net\n ", "thread": {"country": "CA", "domain_rank": 38530, "main_image": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "News Wire", "site": "bnn.ca", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "site_full": "www.bnn.ca", "site_section": "https://www.bnn.ca/news-wire", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "UBS Is Curbing Some China Travel After Banker Detained", "title_full": "UBS Is Curbing Some China Travel After Banker Detained -

For well more than a year, Tesla (TSLA) has been touting an eventual Model 3 with a base price of $35,000 that will be affordable enough to appeal to the masses, but one still is not available.\nIn August, UBS analysts said Tesla would lose money (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-will-lose-money-on-a-cheaper-model-3-analyst-says-2018-08-16) on a Model 3 with a base price of $35,000. Tesla's website says the standard version, which would be expected to have that base price, will begin selling in four to six months.\nIn a tweet Thursday (https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1053061305081315328), Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk claimed the new model \"Costs $35k after federal & state tax rebates in California, but true cost of ownership is closer to $31k after gas savings.\"\nHowever, the tax rebates that apply to all in the U.S. are expiring (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-hits-key-deliveries-threshold-and-that-means-federal-tax-credit-will-be-phased-out-2018-07-12)-- since Tesla has hit a key threshold for deliveries, the federal $7,500 electric-vehicle tax credit will be phased out starting in 2019. For buyers who take delivery from Jan. 1 to June 30, 2019, the credit will drop by half to $3,750, and halved again for the period from July 1 to Dec. 31, 2019, then eliminated entirely in 2020.\nTesla expects to start delivering the Model 3 with the new mid-range batteries in six to 10 weeks, the company said.\n\"As Model 3 production and sales continue to grow rapidly, we've achieved a steady volume in manufacturing capacity, allowing us to diversify our product offering to even more customers,\" a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement. \"Our new mid-range battery is being introduced this week in the U.S. and Canada to better meet the varying range needs of the many customers eager to own Model 3.\"\nThe new version has a range of 260 miles, Tesla said on its website, compared with the previously available 310-mile long-range battery pack. Musk added on Twitter that long-range batteries, rear-wheel drive and \"full self driving\" capabilities will be available for only the next week, and will be \"off menu\" options.\nTesla stock was trading about 2.8% lower Friday, and has declined 15.2% so far this year, as the S&P 500 index has gained 3.6%.\n-Mike Murphy; 1315ET\n ", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": 2618,

Data out earlier this week showed housing starts and building permits also fell more than expected in September.

This year\u2019s event focused on the following question: \u201cIs Community Health Agent Week only important for Community Health Agents?\u201d\nCommunity Health Agents (ASC) are residents of the communities in which they work. They play a fundamental role in the functioning of the federal Family Health Strategy (ESF) program and of Basic Health Units (UBS), comprising part of the primary care teams across Brazil. According to the guidelines established by the National Primary Care Policy (PNAB), Community Health Agents are responsible for monitoring up to 750 people in their respective areas, making periodic home visits; participating in the development of therapeutic projects; recording data on health problems; carrying out demographic, social, cultural, and epidemiological assessments in their designated territory and community; and promoting integration between the healthcare team and local population assigned to each Basic Health Unit, among other responsibilities.\nDuring Community Health Agent Week , seminars and debates were hosted at the Joaquim Ven\u00e2ncio Polytechnic School of Health (EPSJV/ Fiocruz ). Health promotion and disease prevention campaigns took place in Campo da Varginha, in the Manguinhos favela in Rio\u2019s North Zone . A blood drive was also held at the Germano Sinval Faria School Health Center (CSEGSF).\nThe debates were centered on themes such as the 30th anniversary of Brazil\u2019s Unified Health System (SUS), violence and health, the right to housing and basic sanitation, and the challenges that exist for Community Health Agents working within SUS. A panel entitled \u201cHealth in the Crosshairs of Violence\u201d was held on October 2 and was composed of Anast\u00e1cia Santos (COMACS Manguinhos/RJ), Jorge Nadais (COMACS Manguinhos/RJ), and Vera Frossard (psychologist at CSEGSF). The panelists sought to discuss current healthcare challenges in territories marked by various types of violence, such as armed conflict, gender-based violence, and racial violence. Santos raised the issue of the precariousness of public spaces in favelas\u2014necessary for integration among residents and for the promotion of recreational activities, especially taking children into account. She also noted that \u201cthe favela is invisibilized\u2014people are afraid and are silenced through various mechanisms.\u201d\nContinuing the discussion, in the context of personal stories recounted, Nadais commented that \u201csocial inequality is the basis of all other forms of violence that favelas suffer. Growing up in a favela means that you will not have an ordinary life cycle.\u201d He emphasized the specific case of the urban occupation process in the territory of Manguinhos, which received people who had been evicted from other areas of the city such as downtown and the South Zone with the promise that it would only be a temporary home. Over the years, residents gradually rebuilt their lives in the area. In 2009, residents underwent eviction processes yet again \u2014this time due to public works related to the federal Growth Acceleration Program (PAC).\nOne of the challenges posed by psychologist Vera Frossard of CSEGSFV is the low number of reported instances of violence in the Mortality Information System (SIM). Since few cases are actually recorded, violence is rendered invisible when planning public health policies. In contrast, Community Health Agents follow up on reported cases, which often get lost in the bureaucracy. Another very pertinent point made by Frossard related to the self-perception of people who experience violence: \u201cThey blame themselves for the violence that they suffer. This is the violence of violence.\u201d\nAudience members also contributed to the discussion. Mayalu Matos\u2014a researcher at the Jorge Careli Latin American Center for Studies on Violence and Health (CLAVES/FioCruz)\u2014emphasized: \u201cNot only does violence have an impact on health\u2014it is also a violation of rights: the right to life, the right to come and go.\u201d Complementing Matos\u2019 words, F\u00e1bio Monteiro, member of COMACS, highlighted the consequences of routine violence and pointed out that \u201cinvestments in healthcare and education are slow to generate returns, which reveals the need for increased funding and careful planning.\u201d He also insisted on the necessity of ongoing health programs for workers\u2014especially for Community Healthcare Agents, whose needs are urgent.\nAs such, it became clear that the challenges of promoting health in these territories are constant and complex. These challenges may accentuate health issues among healthcare professionals, especially among Community Health Agents\u2014who both live and work in these communities. These processes are exacerbated by policies that reduce healthcare spending and by the changes to the 2017 National Primary Care Policy \u2014which does not define a minimum number of Community Health Agents required for each primary care team and thus could further overburden the profession.\nIn the midst of challenges, there is a great deal of struggle and determination to generate positive outcomes for residents of the community. On October 3 , Community Health Agents organized \u201cFavela Health Day\u201d with actions to promote health and leisure and recreational activities in Campo da Varginha, together with community projects organized by partners of COMACS. As part of the day\u2019s activities, an information booth was set up with materials on prevention, risky behaviors, and health issues\u2014addressing the importance of combating smoking, the necessity of maintaining a healthy diet, and the practice of self-examination for breast cancer prevention.\nIn addition, there were other activities such as a handicraft, cross stitch, crochet, and an embroidery workshop run by the Arteirinhas project\u2014a Community Health Agent initiative at CSEGSF; performances by the group M\u00fasica na Cal\u00e7ada and by the Manguinhos Ballet ; and children\u2019s recreational activities involving painting and drawing by the Recriando Manguinhos Collective . All of these initiatives originated in the community. Throughout the day, children also had space to play on a trampoline and in a ball pit.\nElenice Pessoa\u2014a collaborator at the Recriando Manguinhos Collective who has been working in this area for the past three years\u2014lamented the lack of community integration and recreational activities for children. \u201cWe wonder why there\u2019s no money for health or education but there is money to invest in weapons. Those who want to see change don\u2019t accept this,\u201d she commented. She also emphasized the work of Community Health Agents, who in her eyes \u201care warriors\u2014they do many things with few resources.\u201d\nResponding to the initial question \u201cIs Community Health Agent Week only important for Community Health Agents?,\u201d other professionals, as well as the general population, need to understand the importance of Community Health Agents. They represent the voices of people who live and work in favelas. As Monteiro from COMACS commented, \u201cWe are the ones who must say what we need.

The bank has made at least three new hires in the last month alone.\nAndrew Dawkins, former head of Delta One sales in the Americas for BNP Paribas, joined Citi in October as a managing director working out of New York. Citi also added Claus Hein, former head of synthetic equity distribution for EMEA at Deutsche Bank. Hein started in London last month as a director of Delta One sales. The bank also just poached ex-Goldman Sachs strat Sriram Bharadwaj to work on its forwards desk as a Delta One trader.\nThe hires come nearly a year after Citi hired away three senior Delta One traders from rivals.

The (surely awkward) photos were then included as part of UBS\u2019s pitch.\nNot one to be outdone, Goldman Sachs had its bankers show up to the actual meeting dressed in Lululemon athleisure-wear , with now-CEO David Solomon sporting a maroon blazer and sweatpants. Former Lululemon CEO Robert Meers joked at the time that the company\u2019s sales took a hit when they stopped interviewing banks. For the past decade, the courting of Lululemon has stood as the gold standard for what bankers are willing to do to land a lucrative job. That is until now.\nAs Morgan Stanley\u2019s top technology banker, Michael Grimes has pushed the envelope before. When pitching Pandora ahead of its public offering, Grimes had all his bankers wear t-shirts from their favorite rock concert. To help prepare, he studied his daughter\u2019s usage of the music-streaming service. Consider that child\u2019s play compared to his prep work and dedication to winning over Uber, which is said to be looking to go public early next year.\nGrimes, a millionaire many times over, has reportedly spent years moonlighting as an Uber driver to help position Morgan Stanley as the main contender to underwrite the expectedly-massive IPO, according to the Wall Street Journal . Again, years! All while working the hours necessary to earn roles as the top underwriter for tech giants like Facebook, Snapchat owner Snap Inc. and reportedly Palantir, Peter Thiel\u2019s secretive data mining venture that may fetch a $41 billion valuation when it goes public. One can only imagine what Grimes\u2019 accountant was thinking when they first saw the Uber earnings on his 1099. \u2013 Or what his family was thinking when he had to head off to his \u201csecond job.\u201d Good luck to any tech banker who tries to prove their level of dedication as a trump card with potential clients.\nElsewhere, Business Insider put together a day-in-the-life piece of a San Francisco-based HSBC banker . If the piece is to be believed, every banker in New York and London should quit their job and go work for HSBC in San Francisco tomorrow.\nAfter waking up, Melania Edwards spends around an hour meditating, then FaceTimes with family and friends before playing some tennis. She walks to work and arrives around 9 a.m. Edwards meets with VCs and tech companies in the morning, and then takes lunch at noon. She \u201crefuels\u201d for a quick 90 minutes. In the afternoon, Edwards commutes to her second office in Palo Alto on the train and catches up on some podcasts. When work is done, she volunteers some of her time drafting proposals for a non-profit. \"In my spare time, I try to give back,\" she said. Yoga at 7:30 p.m., then winding down by trying out some new recipes with her boyfriend in her majestic apartment.\nSimilar to how your average day goes? Frankly, it\u2019s extremely hard to believe this depiction \u2013 which set Twitter on fire with jealousy and confusion \u2013 is really accurate. After all, one can only play so much tennis.\nMeanwhile:\nBanks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank are expanding their loan book for multi-millionaire private clients who want to buy things like mansions and art without all the hassle. Deutsche Bank has been hiring in the U.S. while Goldman plans to add to its private bank overseas. ( Bloomberg )\nU.S. bank earnings suggest that UBS may have good news to report. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank could post another disappointing quarter. ( Breaking Views )\nGoldman Sachs will not be sending any of its executives to a high-profile Saudi investment conference next week due to the disappearance and alleged killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Deutsche Bank is said to be on the fence about going , while bankers from HSBC, Societe Generale, Morgan Stanley, Citi and Credit Suisse are reportedly still planning to attend , though things could change. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday said he is scrapping plans to attend \u201cDavos in the Desert.\u201d ( Reuters )\nIf you want to consider yourself part of the top 1% in New York City, you\u2019ll need to earn over $710k per year. Roughly 38,000 people accomplished that feat during 2016. More than 1,400 New Yorkers made at least $10 million.

Stefan Hoops is replacing John Gibbons \u201cwith immediate effect.\u201d ( FT )\nBank of America has cut its headcount by more than 100,000 over the last decade, according to CEO Brian Moynihan. The key to managing the cuts without sinking the business? \u201cLet attrition be your friend,\u201d he said. The 59-year-old Moynihan also said that he plans on running the bank as long as he can, referencing 87-year-old Warren Buffett as an example.

The scams, dubbed \"the biggest tax robbery in European history\", involved Deutsche Bank and Santander - the largest lenders in Germany and Spain. Deutsche Bank also handled billions of illicit Russian funds (Photo: Bjoern Laczay) They also involved Germany's Commerzbank, Hypovereinsbank, Landesbanken, and Warburg Bank, British lender Barclays, French bank BNP Paribas, and global banks JPMorgan, Meryll Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and UBS. The scams worked via so-called \"cum-ex\" buying of shares and bonds. The latin term, which means with-without, is jargon for a kind of trade that enables banks to conceal the identities of their clients. This, in turn, helps the clients to claim false, double, or multiple tax rebates of capital gains tax paid on the anonymous trades.

The Nasdaq composite closed down 0.48% after an earlier rally, and the S&P 500 was mostly flat.\nOvernight, China reported its economy expanded at the slowest pace in a decade during the third quarter. Gross domestic product rose by an annualized 6.5%, a rate not seen since 2009 and compared with expectations for 6.6% growth.\nTop Chinese policymakers, including Vice Premier Liu He, jumped in to reassure businesses and investors who were already shaken by the steepest fall in Chinese equities in three years. Jason Draho, head of Americas asset allocation at UBS, said talk of stimulus programs offered markets some comfort.\n\"How much and how soon the stimulus will arrive is uncertain, so far to soon to say this is a turning point,\" he said. \"Good news on China's growth and trade are two catalysts the market needs to see to get more positive on equities.\"\nMeanwhile, some are worried the Federal Reserve could raise borrowing rates at a pace that may become slightly restrictive.

The travel restrictions have only affected those bankers who help manage money for clients and haven\u2019t been imposed on the securities unit.\nIt was unclear under what circumstances the Singapore-based employee was detained and whether the person has been released.\nAs part of Beijing\u2019s ongoing anti-corruption campaign, government clampdowns and unexplained absences have unsettled executives with operations in China, where even the president Interpol recently disappeared abruptly as a result of a bizarre detention. As reported previously, Meng Hongwei was reported missing this month after being taken into custody upon his arrival from France.\n\u201cChina\u2019s deep into an anti-corruption drive as well as effort to deleverage the economy,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201c\nChina has been a major new market for financial firms such as UBS as the share of world\u2019s wealthy has soared in the region. UBS estimates a new billionaire is minted in China every two days and Credit Suisse this week said China\u2019s total wealth has risen 1,300 percent this century to $51.9 trillion, more than double the rate of any other nation. The number of High Net Worth individuals in Asia-Pac recently surpassed that of North America, and at 6.2 million was the highest of any geographic region in the world.\nTaking advantage of foreign interest in its capital, China has thrown open its financial markets to foreign firms, a move that has given global companies unprecedented access to the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, even as crackdowns on foreign professionals have been on the rise.\nAs for UBS, the world\u2019s largest wealth manager has a long history in China and, according to Bloomberg, claims to have been the first Swiss-based bank to establish a presence in the Asia Pacific region in 1964. The Swiss lender is in talks to acquire a majority stake in its Chinese securities joint venture. UBS is also the largest wealth manager in Asia, with total assets under management of $383 billion at the end of last year.\nIt now remains to be seen if the detained UBS banker was actually guilty of a crime, and if not, whether the Zurich-based bank will forget all about the incident in hopes of further profit upside, or if it will demand fair treatment for its employees at the risk of angering local authorities and having its charter removed for making a big fuss. Considering that UBS has yet to officially confirm this incident ever took place \u2013 a UBS spokesman declined to comment on the ban and detention \u2013 and Bloomberg had to report about it using \u201canonymous sources\u201d, it is pretty clear which way the bank is leaning.

The move has put p rivate banks in Asia on alert.\nBy Shruti Advani, Guest Contributor finews.asia\nOnshore China, and its rapidly growing billionaire population, is a target for most private banks in the region. UBS has arguably the best-established franchise in the competitive onshore market.\nChinese regulators require foreign banks such as UBS to obtain licenses in each jurisdiction that they operate. UBS opened branches in both Beijing in 2014 and Shanghai in 2016 offices, amidst much fanfare and presumably at great cost.\nDue for Interview Next Week\nA female relationship manager at Switzerland's biggest bank this week was detained at the airport in Beijing, according to a source familiar with the matter. The authorities allegedly held the UBS banker on grounds of illegally soliciting business, the source told finews .asia .\nThe relationship manager may have violated stringent Chinese onshore regulations, which declare illegal the marketing and sale of offshore financial products.\nThe banker will be interviewed by Chinese authorities next week, according to information obtained by finews.asia . She has however received back her passport, which had been confiscated. The reasons for her detention remain unclear.\nStrong Message\nThe Swiss bank will not comment on the detention of one of its bankers, but said that it had very stringent rules set for its bankers. \u00abThis is a strong message from the regulator that it will not tolerate fly in banking,\u00bb says one senior banker at another Swiss finance firm. The practice of \u00abflying in\u00bb bankers, ostensibly for legitimate onshore reasons ranging from client meetings to golf trips \u2013 was one favored by many banks in capital controlled markets such as Taiwan and India.\nIt was, however, abandoned as banks \u2013 Swiss wealth managers in particular \u2013 ran into trouble with regulators in these onshore jurisdictions.\n\u00abBreached Lines\u00bb\n\u00abChilling\u00bb is how another senior manager at a European bank described the developments. \u00abThe fact that it is a UBS banker \u2013 and not one at a smaller shop \u2013 is indicative of how determined the regulator is,\u00bb he explains.\nA head of Taiwan business at another private bank says, \u00abthe line continues to be breached several times in onshore markets,\u00bb but it is likely there will be systemic reluctance among both bankers and their banks after the latest incidence.\nHands-Off in China\nWhat this means for banks that have made deep investments in the China onshore market and are under considerable pressure to \u00abmove out of investment phase\u00bb is unknown. For the savvier ones, this is likely to be an inflection point.\n\u00abIt is certainly hands-off China for the moment and we will implement no-fly restrictions in any case where it is ambiguous whether the purpose of the visit is strictly onshore,\u00bb confirms the senior manager.

The identity and position of the banker were not known.

A UBS spokeswoman declined to comment.\nThe Swiss bank is the largest wealth manager operating in Asia, with US$383 billion of assets under management, according to Asian Private Banker magazine, ahead of Citigroup, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Julius Baer.\nThe meeting also comes as UBS has been building up its presence in China. Last week it moved a step closer to becoming the first bank to take majority ownership of its China joint venture under new rules designed to open up the sector, when two of its current partners put their stakes up for sale.\nAny deal on the stakes will need the approval of Chinese authorities, who are yet to give the green light for the 51 per cent shareholding.

A new report suggests it might. Credit: Louie Douvis\nThe report found the rate of industry deflation has eased off in the most recent quarter, largely due to a surge in the cost of fresh food, including meat and dairy produce.\nFigures reveal prices fell 1.3 per cent at Woolworths in the quarter ending June 30, compared with a 0.6 per cent drop in the September quarter.\nAdvertisement It's a stark comparison with March this year, when prices of fresh food fell by almost 3 per cent according to the report.\nBrian Walker, retail analyst and founder of the Retail Doctor Group, said drought historically meant grocery bills soared due to pressures on affected farmers and suppliers.\nGenerally, experts estimate grocery bills can rise at twice the rate of inflation during a drought.\n\"The message Woolworths and Coles are saying is 'well, in this cycle, we can't discount any further so we have to put some of this cost back onto the consumer',\" Mr Walker said.\nHe said while there weren't likely to be huge increases in the cost of staple products such as milk and bread, harder to source fresh food items are likely to less discounted in the coming months.\nA decade ago Woolworths and Coles had, comparatively, among the world's highest operating return.\nBut the brutal competition that Aldi injected into the entire market was responsible for almost unprecedented levels of price cutting.\n\"If we look at Coles and Woolworths now they've all invested into major store refurbishments, service and price drops,\" Mr Walker said.\n\"What price discounting does is compel consumers to spend more when they're at the supermarket. But they're buying those discounts and they can't keep doing that forever.\"\nThe analysts noted that the easing deflationary pressures were a reflection of higher input costs and suggests further price increases are likely down the track.\nThe report noted that measuring Coles trends was difficult, with the supermarket giant recently matching its online prices to in-store prices, but analysts observed Coles was also showing signs of easing deflation rates consistent with Woolworths.\n\"We are now one step closer to inflation and the market is becoming more rational, a positive for sector sales, margin and valuations,\" the report said. \"We expect easing deflationary trends ... to continue.\"\nColes sales grew by 5 per cent in the first quarter, helped by its recent Little Shop toy giveaway \u2013 the chain's most successful campaign of its type.\nSales came in at $9.84 billion for the three months to September 30, compared with $9.37 billion in the prior corresponding quarter.\nColes managing director Steven Cain said earlier this week the Little Shop campaign would now be evaluated by management given its success.\nA Woolworths spokeswoman said fresh food prices have remained \"relatively stable\" across the board.\n\"We continue to monitor commodity markets and feedback from our industry partners closely,\" she said.\n\"As always, we continue to work hard with our suppliers to offer our customers top quality fresh food at the best prices.\"\nColes has been contacted for comment.", "thread": {"country": "AU", "domain_rank": 28115, "main_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0347,$multiply_1,$ratio_1.777778,$width_1059,$x_0,$y_39/t_crop_custom/w_800/t_sharpen,q_auto,f_auto/c2754de41f7101e0e4624e8c1f3f7c8caa3821c0", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-20T21:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Canberra Times - Latest News", "site": "canberratimes.com.au", "site_categories": ["media"], "site_full": "www.canberratimes.com.au", "site_section": "http://feeds.canberratimes.com.au/rssheadlines/top.xml#", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Consumers will start to feel the squeeze at the grocery checkout: report", "title_full": "Consumers will start to feel the squeeze at the grocery checkout: report", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTJ_xPp7HnALN6RzcFHcXosX5X16GRrhKzEu7KYhMtFpEaTB6Po_iTQmZF_vgoa8FXOR8v3fGF6MDwl8E9oPhOnhelFcfu_obEZaLufOUSNHcebuXXrFwNhAdqhiFwra2E5jNOe91DUewYlmYg7kxIurCIWnOZNt.TmGHDBMhtBofAQsNLKHL0OkoB_LJas7YfDFIdNf5RexqrrblYJTOpZA_jCvgKCRsDK_ckviclnxknXYtwsOVJSLKk2mgXQ.k-", "uuid": "cf4483e7acc19aa49ed94d9fad323272407f3b9c"}, "title": "Consumers will start to feel the squeeze at the grocery checkout: report", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSTJ_xPp7HnALN6RzcFHcXosX5X16GRrhKzEu7KYhMtFpEaTB6Po_iTQmZF_vgoa8FXOR8v3fGF6MDwl8E9oPhOnhelFcfu_obEZaLufOUSNHcebuXXrFwNhAdqhiFwra2E5jNOe91DUewYlmYg7kxIurCIWnOZNt.TmGHDBMhtBofAQsNLKHL06J4Dr5BXtME-", "uuid": "09250392e6a0c01c308fb908275ebee15831890b"}, {"author": "admin", "crawled": "2018-10-20T17:01:09.034+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zurich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs group ag", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "reuters/arnd wiegmann", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=HSBA.L", "http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=UBSG.S"], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-20T09:25:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "October 20, 2018 UBS warns staff over China travel after banker held in Beijing: source\nHONG KONG (Reuters) \u2013 Swiss bank UBS Group AG.

The identity and position of the banker were not known.\nThe purpose of the meeting with authorities is not clear, but the bank has asked others in its China wealth management team to review their travel plans carefully.\nNo other units in the bank, including back office or asset management teams, have been asked to re-consider existing travel plans.

Last week it moved a step closer to becoming the first bank to take majority ownership of its China joint venture under new rules designed to open up the sector, when two of its current partners put their stakes up for sale.\nAny deal on the stakes will need the approval of Chinese authorities, who are yet to give the green light for the 51 percent shareholding.

UBS has arguably the best-established franchise in the competitive onshore market.\nChinese regulators require foreign banks such as UBS to obtain licenses in each jurisdiction that they operate. UBS opened branches in both Beijing in 2014 and Shanghai in 2016, amidst much fanfare and presumably at great cost.\nDue for Interview Next Week\nA female relationship manager at Switzerland's biggest bank this week was detained at the airport in Beijing, according to a source familiar with the matter. The authorities allegedly held the UBS banker on grounds of illegally soliciting business, the source told finews .com .\nThe relationship manager may have violated stringent Chinese onshore regulations, which declare illegal the marketing and sale of offshore financial products.\nThe banker will be interviewed by Chinese authorities next week, according to information obtained by finews.com . She has however received back her passport, which had been confiscated. The reasons for her detention remain unclear.\nStrong Message\nThe Swiss bank will not comment on the detention of one of its bankers, but said that it had very stringent rules set for its bankers. \u00abThis is a strong message from the regulator that it will not tolerate fly in banking,\u00bb says one senior banker at another Swiss finance firm. The practice of \u00abflying in\u00bb bankers, ostensibly for legitimate onshore reasons ranging from client meetings to golf trips \u2013 was one favored by many banks in capital controlled markets such as Taiwan and India.\nIt was, however, abandoned as banks \u2013 Swiss wealth managers in particular \u2013 ran into trouble with regulators in these onshore jurisdictions.\n\u00abBreached Lines\u00bb\n\u00abChilling\u00bb is how another senior manager at a European bank described the developments. \u00abThe fact that it is a UBS banker \u2013 and not one at a smaller shop \u2013 is indicative of how determined the regulator is,\u00bb he explains.\nA head of the Taiwan business at another private bank says, \u00abthe line continues to be breached several times in onshore markets\u00bb, but it is likely there will be systemic reluctance among both bankers and their banks after the latest incidence.\nHands-Off in China\nWhat this means for banks that have made deep investments in the China onshore market and are under considerable pressure to \u00abmove out of investment phase\u00bb is unknown. For the savvier ones, this is likely to be an inflection point.\n\u00abIt is certainly hands-off China for the moment and we will implement no-fly restrictions in any case where it is ambiguous whether the purpose of the visit is strictly onshore,\u00bb confirms the senior manager.

The identity and position of the banker were not known.\nThe purpose of the meeting with authorities is not clear, but the bank has asked others in its China wealth management team to review their travel plans carefully.\nNo other units in the bank, including back office or asset management teams, have been asked to re-consider existing travel plans. A UBS spokeswoman declined to comment\nThe Swiss bank is the largest wealth manager operating in Asia, with $383 billion of assets under management, according to Asian Private Banker magazine, ahead of Citigroup, Credit Suisse , HSBC and Julius Baer Bakers.\nThe meeting also comes as UBS has been building up its presence in China. Last week it moved a step closer to becoming the first bank to take majority ownership of its China joint venture under new rules designed to open up the sector, when two of its current partners put their stakes up for sale.\nAny deal on the stakes will need the approval of Chinese authorities, who are yet to give the green light for the 51 percent shareholding.\nReuters", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": "http://img.ednews.net/news/2018/10/photo_329235.jpg", "participants_count": 0, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Eurasia Diary", "site": "ednews.net", "site_categories": [], "site_full": "ednews.net", "site_section": "http://ednews.net/en/rss", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "UBS warns staff over China travel after banker held in Beijing", "title_full": "UBS warns staff over China travel after banker held in Beijing", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JOAPvlhEkIZtcik_y8f9xyZzB3p63QsASCCLqZm82P9yQsM0GKdFC9ZbcL2k1HY2zw4JYtsoTGcBqQavYUwdNkwS83wZpDXJk6MeLgjBCq3fAro8JVKKRWrOOZlKNpcaA-", "uuid": "61ce3976c97a8a25caa7eb29c77a66c474610c23"}, "title": "UBS warns staff over China travel after banker held in Beijing", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JOAPvlhEkIZtcik_y8f9xyZzB3p63QsASCCLqZm82P9yQsM0GKdFC9ZbcL2k1HY2zw4JYtsoTGcBqQavYUwdNkwS83wZpDXJk6MeLgjBCq3fAro8JVKKRWrOOZlKNpcaA-", "uuid": "61ce3976c97a8a25caa7eb29c77a66c474610c23"}, {"author": "Joanna Charbonneau", "crawled": "2018-10-20T17:36:41.015+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ubs group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chaffey breeze  ubs group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california first national bancorp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs group ubs group ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "investment bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asset management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wealth management americas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "personal & corporate banking", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": []}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "\nUBS Group has higher revenue and earnings than California First National Bancorp.\nSummary\nUBS Group beats California First National Bancorp on 9 of the 13 factors compared between the two stocks.\nAbout UBS Group\nUBS Group AG, together with its subsidiaries, provides financial advice and solutions worldwide.

The travel restrictions have only affected those bankers who help manage money for clients and haven\u2019t been imposed on the securities unit.\nIt was unclear under what circumstances the Singapore-based employee was detained and whether the person has been released.\nAs part of Beijing\u2019s ongoing anti-corruption campaign, government clampdowns and unexplained absences have unsettled executives with operations in China, where even the president Interpol recently disappeared abruptly as a result of a bizarre detention. As reported previously, Meng Hongwei was reported missing this month after being taken into custody upon his arrival from France.\n\u201cChina\u2019s deep into an anti-corruption drive as well as effort to deleverage the economy,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201c\nChina has been a major new market for financial firms such as UBS as the share of world\u2019s wealthy has soared in the region. UBS estimates a new billionaire is minted in China every two days and Credit Suisse this week said China\u2019s total wealth has risen 1,300 percent this century to $51.9 trillion, more than double the rate of any other nation. The number of High Net Worth individuals in Asia-Pac recently surpassed that of North America, and at 6.2 million was the highest of any geographic region in the world.\nTaking advantage of foreign interest in its capital, China has thrown open its financial markets to foreign firms, a move that has given global companies unprecedented access to the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, even as crackdowns on foreign professionals have been on the rise.\nAs for UBS, the world\u2019s largest wealth manager has a long history in China and, according to Bloomberg, claims to have been the first Swiss-based bank to establish a presence in the Asia Pacific region in 1964. The Swiss lender is in talks to acquire a majority stake in its Chinese securities joint venture. UBS is also the largest wealth manager in Asia, with total assets under management of $383 billion at the end of last year.\nIt now remains to be seen if the detained UBS banker was actually guilty of a crime, and if not, whether the Zurich-based bank will forget all about the incident in hopes of further profit upside, or if it will demand fair treatment for its employees at the risk of angering local authorities and having its charter removed for making a big fuss. Considering that UBS has yet to officially confirm this incident ever took place \u2013 a UBS spokesman declined to comment on the ban and detention \u2013 and Bloomberg had to report about it using \u201canonymous sources\u201d, it is pretty clear which way the bank is leaning. via zerohedge This article was posted in Uncategorized.
