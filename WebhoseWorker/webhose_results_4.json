I first met producer Heather Smith when her production company Smith x Union was recommended to me for a Hunter Douglas shoot that I was commissioned to do. Heather has an increadible client list including Coke, Wieden+Kennedy, Ogilvy & Mather, and TBWA Chiat Day. I know I could trust her on one of my biggest clients. She knocked it out of the park and we\u2019ve been on many shoots since then for my clients Prometheus Real Estate Group, UBS, and of course Hunter Douglas.\nHeather\u2019s super power is to take the stress out of any big production and make the whole set feel relaxed and well taken care of. You should see the craft table at our shoots: it\u2019s snack nirvana . She\u2019s always a huge help and does everything with grace and kindness. She\u2019s direct, honest, and man does she work hard. She\u2019s the total package and hires only the best crew to help her out. I can\u2019t wait for our next shoot together.\nLet\u2019s meet Heather:\nDescribe what you do and how long you\u2019ve been doing it.\nI\u2019m a producer. I started in the industry at 21 and haven\u2019t looked back. I collect great people along the way to help me. It\u2019s the only way I made it to where I am at today. Amazing help with the best personalities.\nHow did you get your start?\nI found out they were filming Dawson\u2019s Creek near my college in North Carolina. I was fascinated so started to do extra work for money while in college. After my first day on set I was addicted and knew this was in the vein of work I wanted to do, but behind the camera. I just stalked till I found the right person to send my resume and got the job!!! I quit college 6 months short of graduating. My parents cried! I did go back and get my degree but I knew it was an opportunity I couldn\u2019t turn down.\nWho was your first client?\nMy first client as a producer on my own would have been LensCrafters Campaign I LC. We traveled the country and street-casted the whole campaign.\nWhat\u2019s a typical shoot day like for you?\nHopefully, I\u2019m helping the photographer to direct Talent. Hype man is my favorite nickname. I\u2019m also highly involved in the food on set because I know it\u2019s how I\u2019m quietly judged by crew\nI\u2019m usually filling coolers, sending call sheets, helping wardrobe and props, and prepping for the next day. Anything to make the day smooth and efficient. I\u2019m hands-on and love every second of my productions and crew I work with. My crew is my family. I care so much about them and getting to share them with other photographers makes me proud.\nWhat tools do you use to do your job?\nMy mind mostly. Thinking 10 steps ahead to make the day more efficient is the biggest battle.\nWhat was the craziest thing that happened to you on a job?\nI was cornered on a motorhome in a bad part of town by a somewhat insane person. No one was on the motorhome to help so I had to just stall till the driver came back on. It was one of the scariest moments of my life.\nFavorite ice cream?\nCookies and cream. I\u2019m a sucker for it.\nHow can people find out more about you?\nMy Instagram is saturated with my family. It gets more likes than my work posts any day but at the end of the day, we work hard to give to our family and friends so it\u2019s where it all starts and ends.\n", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": null, "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T21:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "LINCOLN BARBOUR", "site": "lincolnbarbour.com", "site_categories": [], "site_full": "www.lincolnbarbour.com", "site_section": "https://www.lincolnbarbour.com", "site_type": "blogs", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Great People = Great Shoots: Heather Smith", "title_full": "Great People = Great Shoots: Heather Smith", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS_J8f548XuSaQEz7VQuoHhYDgYwG74Ha.1RnrpZj5Wrt17T8oyD5HI44wp.BivYE5d6MRkl1Or_b1XtqIb61Tc5TI1MXZYjvdCbQcWSaEd7w--", "uuid": "33ba13c02423bcb83e8bb045d2afd8c5f4c7d2dd"}, "title": "Great People = Great Shoots: Heather Smith", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS_J8f548XuSaQEz7VQuoHhYDgYwG74Ha.1RnrpZj5Wrt17T8oyD5HI44wp.BivYE5d6MRkl1Or_b1XtqIb61Tc5TI1MXZYjvdCbQcWSaEd7w--", "uuid": "33ba13c02423bcb83e8bb045d2afd8c5f4c7d2dd"}, {"author": "", "crawled": "2018-10-22T21:38:38.011+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "ubs private wealth management", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "josh brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ali mccartney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim lebenthal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe terranova", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve weiss", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T18:53:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "Menu SEARCH QUOTES Investors are moving away from companies with a lot of exposure in China, UBS managing director says 2 Hours Ago Traders Joe Terranova, Steve Weiss, Josh Brown and Jim Lebenthal are joined by Ali McCartney, managing director with UBS Private Wealth Management, to discuss whether the market rally will continue or if they believe a bear market is on the way.", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": 767, "main_image": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2018/10/22/105521599-2ED2-FMHR-MarketPanel-102218.600x400.jpg", "participants_count": 0, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T18:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Latest Video", "site": "cnbc.com", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "site_full": "www.cnbc.com", "site_section": "http://www.cnbc.com/id/100004038/device/rss/rss.html", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 2, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Investors are moving away from companies with a lot of exposure in China, UBS managing director says", "title_full": "Investors are moving away from companies with a lot of exposure in China, UBS managing director says", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOtKVKI48LhUKUf75pecEUEW_DjZsbR7WWHtaqTUDdQZQZzcjd8IgHLIp.13fT2OidUaAsUxzmmgXgy7agGsl8VUIT2txkxaIJq_Wb5vhyXUIZI_sHjmdAYDcDXUO8cVJ7vUgQfIR2dbTDvAHICmdpmyzB7.ao5rfYTkte4uQqnTu", "uuid": "c7a83d12f3798ecb365e8404596d01f4c2815e3b"}, "title": "Investors are moving away from companies with a lot of exposure in China, UBS managing director says", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQVnuM8.NLpOtKVKI48LhUKUf75pecEUEW_DjZsbR7WWHtaqTUDdQZQZzcjd8IgHLIp.13fT2OidUaAsUxzmmgXgy7agGsl8VUIT2txkxaIJq_Wb5vhyXUIZI_sHjmdAYDcDXUO8cVJ7vUgQfIR2dbTDvAHICmdpmyzB7.ao5rfYTkte4uQqnTu", "uuid": "c7a83d12f3798ecb365e8404596d01f4c2815e3b"}, {"author": "News-Ticker", "crawled": "2018-10-22T22:04:23.140+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": []}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T21:50:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "Copyright All Rights Reserved \u00a9 2017 Contact Us\nWe're not around right now.

Voting documents now need to be posted to arrive by 5pm on election day Friday 26 October.\n\u201cC&R are relying on a low voter turnout to continue plans to privatise Vector. It is unacceptable that C&R has continued to spin the line that voting for them equals a $350 pay-out without fronting up throughout the whole campaign to explain their policies that actually put this annual payment at risk\u201d says City Vision for Entrust team leader and former cabinet minister Peter Neilson.\n\u201cThere is a current proposal confirmed by the Chair of Vector, the NBR, and The Australian that the UBS merchant bank wants to introduce a buyer to purchase the Vector\u2019s Auckland electricity network. Privatisation would likely cut or eliminate the current $350 annual payment as under the Entrust trust deed it is the Auckland Council that has a claim on the proceeds from a sale of Vector not the recipients of the annual payment\u201d.\nC&R trustees have held all five trustee positions for the last 9 years. Over the last 3 years while the current all C&R trustees have been in place; the $350 annual payment buys less having fallen behind prices, the trustees let Vector cut the budget for undergrounding, leaving the poles and wires that are an eyesore, and are vulnerable in storms, causing power cuts, and when the April storms occurred cutting power to 200,000 Aucklanders the current trustees took no action to see if Vector\u2019s power supply could be made more reliable and future recoveries faster.\nWhile this has all been occurring the trustees have been fighting amongst themselves. One even taking another trustee to court and another one, has accused their Entrust Chair of \u201cbullying\u201d and of acting in an \u201cunprofessional\u201d manner when the long-term Chair of Vector Michael Stiassny was fired.\nOnly the City Vision (Labour and Green) Entrust trustee candidates Glenda Fryer, Richard Leckinger, Simon Mitchell, Peter Neilson and Robert Reid are pledged to; Protect and enhance the annual $350 payment by, opposing any form of Vector privatisation and by reviewing the operations of both Vector and Entrust. Accelerate the undergrounding programme and investigating new ways to fund that work to improve the urban environment, enhance safety and prevent power cuts. Address energy poverty including looking to see if the annual $350 payment can be paid earlier, closer to the time the big winter power bill arrives, to help the most vulnerable. Work to ensure people who understand Auckland are appointed to the Vector board and Entrust who also better reflect the diversity of Auckland.\n\u201cOnly the City Vision Team is standing on policies that will ensure Vector is not privatised and the annual payment is safe. This has been the most bizarre election I have experienced, the C&R trustees seeking re-election refuse to be interviewed or debate their record and policy\u201d \u201cThe only defence against such arrogance is to make sure more of us vote in the Entrust election so they get the message\u201d says Mr Neilson.

Voting documents now need to be posted to arrive by 5pm on election day Friday 26 October.\n\u201cC&R are relying on a low voter turnout to continue plans to privatise Vector. It is unacceptable that C&R has continued to spin the line that voting for them equals a $350 pay-out without fronting up throughout the whole campaign to explain their policies that actually put this annual payment at risk\u201d says City Vision for Entrust team leader and former cabinet minister Peter Neilson.\n\u201cThere is a current proposal confirmed by the Chair of Vector, the NBR, and The Australian that the UBS merchant bank wants to introduce a buyer to purchase the Vector\u2019s Auckland electricity network. Privatisation would likely cut or eliminate the current $350 annual payment as under the Entrust trust deed it is the Auckland Council that has a claim on the proceeds from a sale of Vector not the recipients of the annual payment\u201d.\nC&R trustees have held all five trustee positions for the last 9 years. Over the last 3 years while the current all C&R trustees have been in place;the $350 annual payment buys less having fallen behind prices,the trustees let Vector cut the budget for undergrounding, leaving the poles and wires that are an eyesore, and are vulnerable in storms, causing power cuts, andwhen the April storms occurred cutting power to 200,000 Aucklanders the current trustees took no action to see if Vector\u2019s power supply could be made more reliable and future recoveries faster.\nWhile this has all been occurring the trustees have been fighting amongst themselves. One even taking another trustee to court and another one, has accused their Entrust Chair of \u201cbullying\u201d and of acting in an \u201cunprofessional\u201d manner when the long-term Chair of Vector Michael Stiassny was fired.\nOnly the City Vision (Labour and Green) Entrust trustee candidates Glenda Fryer, Richard Leckinger, Simon Mitchell, Peter Neilson and Robert Reid are pledged to;Protect and enhance the annual $350 payment by, opposing any form of Vector privatisation and by reviewing the operations of both Vector and Entrust.Accelerate the undergrounding programme and investigating new ways to fund that work to improve the urban environment, enhance safety and prevent power cuts.\nAddress energy poverty including looking to see if the annual $350 payment can be paid earlier, closer to the time the big winter power bill arrives, to help the most vulnerable.\nWork to ensure people who understand Auckland are appointed to the Vector board and Entrust who also better reflect the diversity of Auckland.\n\u201cOnly the City Vision Team is standing on policies that will ensure Vector is not privatised and the annual payment is safe. This has been the most bizarre election I have experienced, the C&R trustees seeking re-election refuse to be interviewed or debate their record and policy\u201d \u201cThe only defence against such arrogance is to make sure more of us vote in the Entrust election so they get the message\u201d says Mr Neilson.\nEnds\n\u00a9 Scoop Media In response to the challenges facing Scoop and the media industry we\u2019ve instituted an Ethical Paywall to keep the news freely available to the public.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-hoon\nBNP Paribas and JPMorgan have also asked their private banking employees to reconsider their China travel plans after the authorities\u2019 action against the UBS banker, two people familiar with the matter said.\nSwiss private bank Julius Baer, which manages assets worth $390 billion globally, has asked staff to be cautious about China travel plans, a separate person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nThe Singapore-based UBS banker, who is a client relationship manager in the Swiss bank\u2019s wealth management unit, still has her passport, but was last week asked to delay her departure from Beijing and remain in China to meet with local authority officials this week. Her identity was not known.\nThe purpose of the meeting with Chinese authorities is not clear. UBS has declined to comment on the matter. However, the uncertainty has led the Swiss bank, and now several of its rivals, to require their private banking staff carefully consider trips to China, the sources said.\nTheir caution highlights the risks involved for global private banks in pursuing what is arguably the biggest opportunity worldwide in the wealth management business.\nChina is the biggest growth driver of the wealth industry in Asia with its large and growing pool of millionaires and billionaires spawned by the country\u2019s booming technology sector, making it a key battleground for global private banks.\nBut its financial sector is under sharp scrutiny as Beijing attempts to lower high debt levels in the economy and curb an outflow of capital from the country to shore up the yuan, meaning there is very little room for error by industry players.\nBNP, Citi, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, and Julius Baer declined to comment. All the sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. FREQUENT TRAVEL\nUBS is unusual in having an onshore wealth management business in China as well as its offshore operations, but almost all other banks advise wealthy Chinese individuals from offshore locations mainly in Hong Kong and Singapore.\nMost offshore wealth managers travel frequently to China for informal meetings with clients, but they are not allowed to either solicit onshore business or market widely offshore investments to onshore clients.\nCiti asked staff in its Asia Pacific private banking team, via a brief email on Sunday, to postpone all China travel, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nJPMorgan has informally advised its private banking managers to review their upcoming China travel plans, three people said.\nBank of Singapore, the private banking arm of Singapore\u2019s OCBC Bank, has told staff they can continue with their ongoing China trips, but should be cautious in future travel to the mainland, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\nA Bank of Singapore spokesman declined to comment.\nUBS is the largest wealth manager operating in Asia, with $383 billion of assets under management, according to Asian Private Banker magazine, ahead of Citi, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Julius Baer.\nCredit Suisse has not imposed any travel ban on its private bankers on China travel, a spokeswoman said.\nThe number of high net-worth individuals \u2013 those with at least $1 million to invest \u2013 rose by 12 percent last year in Asia Pacific, exceeding growth rates anywhere else in the world, according to consultant CapGemini.

Still, the UBS France CEO said, French bankers raised the alarm each time they had concerns their Swiss colleagues might be illegally poaching residents in France. The concerns raised would then be straightened out with the Zurich-based bank, as the investigation case file shows, de Leusse said.\nThe Paris trial also includes allegations that UBS assisted French customers between 2004 and 2012 by providing services such as numbered accounts or by setting up trusts to launder funds they hadn\u2019t declared to tax authorities.\nThe money-laundering accusations can lead to fines of as much as half the amount of the funds stashed offshore for clients.

Only 30 per cent of the parents in the country are capable of guiding their children. The responsibility of the remaining children is on teachers. We are the people who can bring this change.\u201d He suggested the principals to strictly ensure discipline in schools. Bawa added, \u201cCurrently discipline is the least important thing in this country. We have to be ruthless in ensuring discipline because parents are not much serious about this important factor. Mobile phones, films and TV serials have been a major reason behind indiscipline among children. In the corporate world or any other place, indiscipline is not tolerated. To keep children away from distractions like mobile phones and films, you have to strengthen their base. Talk to them and teach them what is right and wrong.\u201d\nChallenge yourself\nBawa asked the principals to challenge themselves.

Everybody has immense talent.\u201d He asked the principals to make students potentially great professionals and also enable them understand the socio-economic scenario of the country. \"Educational institutions should not only produce professionals but also responsible citizens,\" he said.\nNever give up\nGuest of honour Dr Manoj K Sharma, Professor, University Business School (UBS), Panjab University, asked the principals to be ready for the change. \u201cOur goals are changing. We will have to talk about it. To ensure success, three Ds \u2014diligence, discipline and dedication\u2014 are required.\u201d Motivating the principals, he said, \u201cWhen you face difficult situations, you should do environment analysis. Change your thinking with time and you will be in a win-win situation. Never give up. After every failure, just change your strategy and work hard. You will always find a way to win. The environment has changed drastically with time. In this environment, it is appropriate to change and try something different.\"", "thread": {"country": "SG", "domain_rank": 14236, "main_image": "https://images.tribuneindia.com/cms/gall_content/2018/10/2018_10$largeimg23_Tuesday_2018_020208667.jpg", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T21:07:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "The Tribune, Chandigarh, Mohali, Panchkula news ", "site": "tribuneindia.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "site_full": "www.tribuneindia.com", "site_section": "http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/cities/chandigarh/", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Upgrade with time, focus on discipline & talk to kids often", "title_full": "Upgrade with time, focus on discipline & talk to kids often", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_6t5KmapPf.DpRc7O053XOA6LFL40UnSEGXx_gOHnhwztY6qoEfRdCGNTi_uZ9SoN87vxQ4nbWEPqUvjQBzAiEjWrQMbTOExBtlD.qPO.DYUeGVfMyWn9ey9OpAqJi1LoGbc6uweqrcJhl3lT6tlo6", "uuid": "a909078c706f5c05f13f6a95178cc8b6ad6549d3"}, "title": "Upgrade with time, focus on discipline & talk to kids often", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_6t5KmapPf.DpRc7O053XOA6LFL40UnSEGXx_gOHnhwztY6qoEfRdCGNTi_uZ9SoN87vxQ4nbWEPqUvjQBzAiEjWrQMbTOExBtlD.qPO.DYUeGVfMyWn9ey9OpAqJi1LoGbc6uweqrcJhl3lT6tlo6", "uuid": "a909078c706f5c05f13f6a95178cc8b6ad6549d3"}, {"author": "", "crawled": "2018-10-23T00:33:45.040+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rose capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs ag", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose capital ventures ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tnn more", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "vijay mallya", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "siddharth mallya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lalitha mallya", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-21T12:57:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "More trouble for Vijay Mallya, Swiss bank moves court to evict him from London home 2517 views Oct 21, 2018, 15:27 IST More trouble for Vijay Mallya, Swiss bank moves court to evict him from London home Oct 21, 2018, 15:27 IST Source: TNN More trouble builds up for Vijay Mallya as Swiss bank UBS AG seeks possession of his Regent Park multi-million-pound mansion in London.

The move raises the stakes for the bank.\nMegan Butler is the head of Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, and undoubtedly a very busy woman. But she is taking time and getting personally involved in the case of a UBS banker who says she was raped last year by a superior, according to investment banking outlet \u00abFinancial News\u00bb .\nButler, a lawyer with more than two decades experience in both regulation and the private sector, revealed last year that she had a victim of sexual misconduct. She has also promised the City's women that the FCA will pay more attention to bullying and harassment in finance.\nUnconventional Oversight\nHer personal involvement is unusual and follows the news last week that the victim was harassed by another colleague just months before the alleged rape. The FCA didn't comment on Butler's involvement.\nThe website said the case has become \u00abincreasingly significant\u00bb for the British regulator, which means the stakes has risen for UBS. The Swiss bank is under pressure to respond carefully and thoughtfully, after it appears to have bumbled the initial reaction to the claims raised by the female banker, who is no longer with UBS.\nCultural Tidal Wave\nThe bank is caught up in a cultural tidal wave that is redefining what is and isn't acceptable workplace behavior in traditionally male-dominated finance. UBS, which has hired Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer as outside counsel, has said it has zero tolerance for misconduct and harassment, and will thoroughly investigate the claims.

While both titles understandably have a lot of gaming fans in an excited frenzy, a recent survey indicates that Activision and Treyarch\u2019s first-person shooter is more anticipated than Rockstar Games\u2019 open world western release.\nAs seen in the chart below based on a UBS Survey among more than 5,000 gamers across five key markets, it appears as if Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 not only has a slightly higher percentage of players likely to buy it over Red Dead Redemption 2 , but also more have already purchased the former than pre-ordered the latter so far. Interestingly enough, the survey also points to a somewhat increased interest in purchasing Assassin\u2019s Creed: Odyssey instead of RDR2 .\nFor those unaware, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 has been out for a little over a week at this point, so there\u2019s a chance that certain numbers in the above survey change in favor of Red Dead Redemption 2 once it becomes available to everyone. After all, very little in the way of real-time gameplay has been shown of RDR2 , so perhaps Rockstar\u2019s forthcoming open world title will manage to turn more heads than Black Ops 4 when the inevitable droves of in-depth gameplay videos make their way online after launch.\nAll things considered, with positive reviews and generally solid player feedback, the Call of Duty brand has seemingly managed to cinch the majority of the gaming public\u2019s attention for yet another year running with Black Ops 4 . However, it will be interesting to see if Red Dead Redemption 2 goes on to be viewed in an even more favorable light. Should that occur, then perhaps RDR2 will end up being crowned the king of 2018 in terms of both sales and critical reception when all\u2019s said and done.\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 4 is available now for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

But in the meantime, his board has reprioritised the company's portfolio review. by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald When AMP chairman David Murray recruited Credit Suisse veteran Francesco de Ferrari to run the financial services heavyweight in August, fund managers and analysts were quick to think about how the pair would want to re-shape the organisation.\nBut with de Ferrari still not due to arrive for another six weeks, the same fundies and analysts may be wise to ask what AMP will look like when he arrives.\nBecause from what we hear, the fact that AMP is still awaiting its new leader hasn't stopped the company's dealmakers from pursuing some corporate activity.\nAnd the activity is understood to have stepped up in recent weeks, with its external advisers at investment banks UBS and Macquarie in tow.\nThe most obvious place to look is a bucket of businesses former AMP boss Craig Meller classified as non-growth and \"manage for value\". Meller made it clear the wealth protection, New Zealand and mature units could be hived off or restructured if there was a willing suitor able to negotiate the tricky regulatory landscape.\n board has mulled over plenty of options for each of the aforementioned units - as seen in board papers released as part of the banking royal commission. The then board would be regularly updated on \"Project Advance\" , which was the portfolio review designed to work out what to do with the ex-growth parts.\nSo with the spotlight off AMP at the royal commission, and its three new directors on board, it seems AMP may finally be closer to getting some action out of its long-talked about portfolio review.\nAnalysts reckon life, mature and New Zealand are each worth $1 billion to $1.5 billion, based on earnings multiples of between 9 and 13-times forecast profit.\nAny movement is likely to be well received by fund managers, who reckon an asset sale or two could only re-focus attention on AMP's sum-of-the-parts valuation. Should the market re-focus on AMP's sum-of-the-parts, its shares would be expected to stop trading in the $3 to $3.20 range pretty quickly.\nFinally, gyms owner Viva Leisure has fixed its initial public offering price at $1 a share, according to terms sent to fund managers .\nThat represents 5 times forecast earnings on an enterprise value to EBITDA basis,17.6 times forward profit and 11.8 times forward profit once cash is stripped out.", "thread": {"country": "AU", "domain_rank": 16906, "main_image": "https://www.afr.com/content/dam/images/h/1/2/7/r/e/image.related.afrArticleLead.620x365.h16x9r.png/1540195588922.jpg", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T06:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Financial Review - Business, Finance and Investment News | afr.com", "site": "afr.com", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "site_full": "www.afr.com", "site_section": "https://www.afr.com/", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Deal brewing as AMP portfolio review ramps up", "title_full": "Deal brewing as AMP portfolio review ramps up | afr.com", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSONYI1RbA4jzbJNJV01HoZcPR.9XH80P1nkxiuU_HiQXRNUuofgBft46anEE6ZaUnOfPo5kWspNqYV6n2pSS.je5f3ZAvm_F_2PqcB2WjHx0IXJ_skP1_F", "uuid": "1585880e1ffaa86f5bc4320740763f064c4d1b60"}, "title": "Deal brewing as AMP portfolio review ramps up", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSONYI1RbA4jzbJNJV01HoZcPR.9XH80P1nkxiuU_HiQXRNUuofgBft46anEE6ZaUnOfPo5kWspNqYV6n2pSS.je5f3ZAvm_F_2PqcB2WjHx0IXJ_skP1_F", "uuid": "1585880e1ffaa86f5bc4320740763f064c4d1b60"}, {"author": "", "crawled": "2018-10-23T01:55:19.004+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shanghai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anhui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "midea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fuyang", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "midea group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china daily", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastmoney information co ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "government of singapore investment corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan stanley", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "shi jing", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lu qijian", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "Despite slump, QFIIs swear by A shares By Shi Jing in Shanghai | China Daily | Updated: 2018-10-22 10:38 An investor checks stock prices at a brokerage in Fuyang, Anhui province.

Given China's reasonably stable mid- to long-term economic performance, the A-share market will likely pick up, analysts said.\n\"In the short term, we can see some foreign investors withdrawing from the Chinese mainland market due to the rise of the US bond yield. Foreign capital flowing into the global securities markets will reduce, and the A-share market won't be exempted from these cuts,\" he said.\n\"But as the US economy reaches the pinnacle of its growth curve and China's foreign exchange pressure reduces, policies will focus more on the domestic economy. Long-term investment capital will also look for assets in the emerging markets.\"\nMedha Samant, Fidelity International's investment director for Asian equities, said the Chinese stock market presents relatively low valuations now, making its returns the best in Asia. Rising domestic consumption in China will be a major pillar of the country's economic growth, she said.\nShe also said Fidelity stresses on market investments in Asia, given abundant opportunities in China and parts of the ASEAN countries.\nCompanies benefiting from the local economic growth, rising consumption and more emphasis on insurance and medical care will generate higher quality growth, and stocks of such companies will be the main targets of QFIIs, she said.

Given China's reasonably stable mid- to long-term economic performance, the A-share market will likely pick up, analysts said.\n\"In the short term, we can see some foreign investors withdrawing from the Chinese mainland market due to the rise of the US bond yield. Foreign capital flowing into the global securities markets will reduce, and the A-share market won't be exempted from these cuts,\" he said.\n\"But as the US economy reaches the pinnacle of its growth curve and China's foreign exchange pressure reduces, policies will focus more on the domestic economy. Long-term investment capital will also look for assets in the emerging markets.\"\nMedha Samant, Fidelity International's investment director for Asian equities, said the Chinese stock market presents relatively low valuations now, making its returns the best in Asia. Rising domestic consumption in China will be a major pillar of the country's economic growth, she said.\nShe also said Fidelity stresses on market investments in Asia, given abundant opportunities in China and parts of the ASEAN countries.\nCompanies benefiting from the local economic growth, rising consumption and more emphasis on insurance and medical care will generate higher quality growth, and stocks of such companies will be the main targets of QFIIs, she said.

It is unacceptable that C&R has continued to spin the line that voting for them equals a $350 pay-out without fronting up throughout the whole campaign to explain their policies that actually put this annual payment at risk\u201d says City Vision for Entrust team leader and former cabinet minister Peter Neilson.\n\u201cThere is a current proposal confirmed by the Chair of Vector, the NBR, and The Australian that the UBS merchant bank wants to introduce a buyer to purchase the Vector\u2019s Auckland electricity network. Privatisation would likely cut or eliminate the current $350 annual payment as under the Entrust trust deed it is the Auckland Council that has a claim on the proceeds from a sale of Vector not the recipients of the annual payment\u201d.\nC&R trustees have held all five trustee positions for the last 9 years. Over the last 3 years while the current all C&R trustees have been in place; the $350 annual payment buys less having fallen behind prices, the trustees let Vector cut the budget for undergrounding, leaving the poles and wires that are an eyesore, and are vulnerable in storms, causing power cuts, and when the April storms occurred cutting power to 200,000 Aucklanders the current trustees took no action to see if Vector\u2019s power supply could be made more reliable and future recoveries faster.\nWhile this has all been occurring the trustees have been fighting amongst themselves. One even taking another trustee to court and another one, has accused their Entrust Chair of \u201cbullying\u201d and of acting in an \u201cunprofessional\u201d manner when the long-term Chair of Vector Michael Stiassny was fired.\nOnly the City Vision (Labour and Green) Entrust trustee candidates Glenda Fryer, Richard Leckinger, Simon Mitchell, Peter Neilson and Robert Reid are pledged to; Protect and enhance the annual $350 payment by, opposing any form of Vector privatisation and by reviewing the operations of both Vector and Entrust. Accelerate the undergrounding programme and investigating new ways to fund that work to improve the urban environment, enhance safety and prevent power cuts.\nAddress energy poverty including looking to see if the annual $350 payment can be paid earlier, closer to the time the big winter power bill arrives, to help the most vulnerable.\nWork to ensure people who understand Auckland are appointed to the Vector board and Entrust who also better reflect the diversity of Auckland.\n\u201cOnly the City Vision Team is standing on policies that will ensure Vector is not privatised and the annual payment is safe. This has been the most bizarre election I have experienced, the C&R trustees seeking re-election refuse to be interviewed or debate their record and policy\u201d \u201cThe only defence against such arrogance is to make sure more of us vote in the Entrust election so they get the message\u201d says Mr Neilson.\nEnds", "thread": {"country": "NZ", "domain_rank": 64392, "main_image": "", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T09:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "auckland.scoop.co.nz", "site": "scoop.co.nz", "site_categories": [], "site_full": "auckland.scoop.co.nz", "site_section": "http://auckland.scoop.co.nz/feed/", "site_type": "blogs", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Final days to vote and decide the future of Vector", "title_full": "Final days to vote and decide the future of Vector", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Ryv9JL1NXZDJbx3zCZFly.3yzDb9a2lj8RlCbWzyK1O2YVrsuMCjOMuFt_G5VVSerXEgb2j8WNu.q7oYspvoADyK_CdhoBEGbBVhM7d6ZT4A--", "uuid": "b446900b897083f4ca59779935b5bf2f6d559a7b"}, "title": "Final days to vote and decide the future of Vector", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21Ryv9JL1NXZDJbx3zCZFly.3yzDb9a2lj8RlCbWzyK1O2YVrsuMCjOMuFt_G5VVSerXEgb2j8WNu.q7oYspvoADyK_CdhoBEGbBVhM7d6ZT4A--", "uuid": "b446900b897083f4ca59779935b5bf2f6d559a7b"}, {"author": "", "crawled": "2018-10-23T02:21:58.011+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "statista", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "holiday season black ops", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "black ops", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spyro reignited trilogy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "battlefield v", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assassin\u2019s creed odyssey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "red dead redemption", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifa", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "creed odys", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "madden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin stevens", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": ["https://www.statista.com/chart/15844/most-anticipated-video-games/", "https://www.businessinsider.com/ubs-report-is-bullish-on-2018-holiday-video-game-sales-from-activision-2018-10?IR=T"], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T22:16:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "Black Ops 4 Tops Survey of Most Anticipated 2018 Games for This Holiday Season Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey, Red Dead Redemption 2 come close.

The survey\u2019s results show a highly promising holiday season for the gaming industry.\nOf those surveyed, 6% of respondents said they had already purchased or preordered Black Ops 4, with 34% saying they were likely to buy the game. Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey reached second, with 4% purchased or preordered and 33% likely to buy, and Red Dead Redemption 2 snagging third with 5% preordered and 31% likely to buy.\nThe rest of the games to reach the top 12 in this survey include FIFA 19, Battlefield V, Fallout 76, World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth, Destiny 2: Forsaken, The Division 2, Spyro Reignited Trilogy, NBA 2K19, and Madden NFL 19.", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": 383, "main_image": "https://sm.ign.com/ign_nordic/news/b/black-ops-/black-ops-4-tops-survey-of-most-anticipated-2018-games-for-t_tm3n.png", "participants_count": 0, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T22:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "IGN Nordic", "site": "ign.com", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "site_full": "nordic.ign.com", "site_section": "http://nordic.ign.com/feed.xml", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Black Ops 4 Tops Survey of Most Anticipated 2018 Games for This Holiday Season", "title_full": "Black Ops 4 Tops Survey of Most Anticipated 2018 Games for This Holiday Season", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfaift3PS4b30DgT.hq6J8tzQ7lYFCL87nhQafsMF35.L.DUApZ1n9lgUFJdS28yauvPFFCNxlJkTAH1L6A74CzQqwu8uYzGN3T6e8iQG2q9cinMAhSaT05TkNT9WF.6Klvf01qUSm1pRRoMLQ16Xc", "uuid": "c54c3bfaebe94c0871a011d97bd3cb3d7f67e293"}, "title": "Black Ops 4 Tops Survey of Most Anticipated 2018 Games for This Holiday Season", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRfaift3PS4b30DgT.hq6J8tzQ7lYFCL87nhQafsMF35.L.DUApZ1n9lgUFJdS28yauvPFFCNxlJkTAH1L6A74CzQqwu8uYzGN3T6e8iQG2q9cinMAhSaT05TkNT9WF.6Klvf01qUSm1pRRoMLQ16Xc", "uuid": "c54c3bfaebe94c0871a011d97bd3cb3d7f67e293"}, {"author": "rttnews.com", "crawled": "2018-10-23T02:50:52.006+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [], "organizations": [{"name": "nestle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "credit suisse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adecco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novartis", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "givaudan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roche", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julius baer", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T20:07:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "By RTTNews Staff Writer | Published: 10/22/2018 12:07 PM ET\nThe Swiss stock market got off to a positive start Monday, but pared its gains in early trade.

With Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 and Red Dead Redemption 2 both becoming available this month, it\u2019s no wonder why many consider the release schedule for October 2018 to be one of the most jam-packed timetables for highly awaited games in recent memory. While both titles understandably have a lot of gaming fans in an excited frenzy, a recent survey indicates that Activision and Treyarch\u2019s first-person shooter is more anticipated than Rockstar Games\u2019 open world western release.As seen in the chart below based on a UBS Survey among more than 5,000 gamers across five key markets, it appears as if Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 not only has a slightly higher percentage of players likely to buy it over Red Dead Redemption 2, but also more have already purchased the former than pre-ordered the latter so far. Interestingly enough, the survey also points to a somewhat increased interest in purchasing Assassin\u2019s Creed: Odyssey instead of RDR2.For those unaware, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 has been out for a little over a week at this point, so there\u2019s a chance that certain numbers in the above survey change in favor of Red Dead Redemption 2 once it becomes available to everyone. After all, very little in the way of real-time gameplay has been shown of RDR2, so perhaps Rockstar\u2019s forthcoming open world title will manage to turn more heads than Black Ops 4 when the inevitable droves of in-depth gameplay videos make their way online after launch.All things considered, with positive reviews and generally solid player feedback, the Call of Duty brand has seemingly managed to cinch the majority of the gaming public\u2019s attention for yet another year running with Black Ops 4.

But without the right data, they may still be feeling around in the dark.\nOversight and supervision of non-financial risks have long been part of the day job for senior banking and investment management executives, particularly as more headline-making examples of rogue traders and pockets of fraudulent activity in specific business units have cropped up at universal banks in past years. Think Adoboli at UBS, or the more recent billion-dollar enforcement action against Wells Fargo.\nThe approach to dealing with these risks has taken two directions. On one hand, Individual accountability regimes have pushed these responsibilities further down to senior managers\u2014the first in the classic three lines of organisational defence. But, despite this expanded ownership for assessing, controlling, and mitigating risks, they often lack the resources, expertise or political clout to secure investment, implement automated solutions, and ultimately make positive and sustainable change happen. They need support from the second line of defence\u2014professional risk, compliance, and control functions\u2014and from the C-suite, governing bodies, and the independent third line. And so, on the other hand, non-financial risk responsibility is now vested at the boardroom level, as well. Enter the Chief Control Officer .\nWhilst Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and the more familiar Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) positions are well-understood and have, within most regulated firms, been in place for a decade or more, this new talisman for internal controls is relatively immature and indeed, the role is still being shaped.\nIn general, the CCO for controls has a cross-functional remit focussed on managing down operational and conduct risks and other non-financial risks. The role contributes to the formulation of risk management and control strategy and policy, and is key to instilling a healthy risk culture within enterprise operations. The meat of the job, however, is active oversight: monitoring and mitigation of risk of loss or regulatory attention. The CCO is ultimately accountable for the effective execution of the control framework; that\u2019s where most of his or her challenges lie. And to this extent, the role serves as a gatherer, consumer, and distributor of data as much as it does a policymaker.\nBecause of the reputational risk and considerable penalties now in play, there is an inexorable march towards more granular and more real-time controls among the world\u2019s largest institutions. The new CCO role only highlights the opportunity firms have to fundamentally change their organisation\u2019s approach to the controls lifecycle. Senior managers need to be able to identify and assess gaps, and design, build, and implement controls into their operations much faster. Contrary to the old notions of controls as crusty rules living only on paper, they now expect flexibility and \u201ccontrol on-demand\u201d capabilities from their CCO colleagues, and we are seeing a new control-as-a-service concept evolve as result. Just as firms today can deploy internal factories for building and deploying analytic models, utilities for reconciliations, and centres of excellence for new initiatives like robotics, we are seeing the concept of controls being delivered as-a-service, leveraging the capabilities of agile technologies and robust data management platforms.\nAs the role continues to evolve, the CCO cannot be successful without effective monitoring systems, high-quality data, and actionable information drawn from that data. The CCO is heavily reliant on colleagues in operations and technology, but this role can also set the agenda and be instigators of change when it comes to the systems modernisation agenda. In fact, operations chiefs and tech teams are equally frustrated about their complex data spaghetti, inflexible processing platforms, and their critical\u2014but typically expensive and cumbersome\u2014legacy reconciliation systems. Without a refresh in these core areas and establishing baseline data about trading and business activity, it is difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014 to develop effective controls around organisational behaviour and individual conduct.\nTo this extent, the CCO should be driving the argument, bringing to bear new influence, leveraging a growing mandate from the boardroom, and ultimately striving to consummate broad-based technology transformation that puts controls at the center of the enterprise.", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": "https://www.greshamtech.com/hubfs/teamleader-with-his-team-symbol-for-leadership-with-game-figures-in-picture-id682749890.jpg?t=1540221970908#keepProtocol", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-23T00:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Blog", "site": "greshamtech.com", "site_categories": [], "site_full": "www.greshamtech.com", "site_section": "https://www.greshamtech.com/blog/rss.xml", "site_type": "blogs", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "A New Leader for Driving Enterprise Control", "title_full": "A New Leader for Driving Enterprise Control", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS_t9u.piWMRyN8_RQ_Jb6JUFzCrT46rhseLdEpljW9oeVpxQnaDFJtTLG5i9UWJSm2NzlpyuBa1HVpGVUJ60jLp5pB91M_fkw-", "uuid": "45ff09a7fcb5c97da51b20767c5eecc9e20033f6"}, "title": "A New Leader for Driving Enterprise Control", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS_t9u.piWMRyN8_RQ_Jb6JUFzCrT46rhseLdEpljW9oeVpxQnaDFJtTLG5i9UWJSm2NzlpyuBa1HVpGVUJ60jLp5pB91M_fkw-", "uuid": "45ff09a7fcb5c97da51b20767c5eecc9e20033f6"}, {"author": "", "crawled": "2018-10-23T04:30:06.009+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "minsk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belarus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jumia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south and north america", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national agency of investment", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "contour global", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amr industry alliance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siemens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finance ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nestle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "novartis", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "aviva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elena perminova", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?text=Belarus%20to%20attend%20World%20Investment%20Forum%20in%20Geneva&url=http%3A%2F%2Feng.belta.by%2Feconomics%2Fview%2Fbelarus-to-attend-world-investment-forum-in-geneva-115824-2018%2F&counturl=http%3A%2F%2Feng.belta.by%2Feconomics%2Fview%2Fbelarus-to-attend-world-investment-forum-in-geneva-115824-2018%2F", "http://www.odnoklassniki.ru/dk?st.cmd=addShare&st.s=1?&st._surl=http%3A%2F%2Feng.belta.by%2Feconomics%2Fview%2Fbelarus-to-attend-world-investment-forum-in-geneva-115824-2018%2F&st.comments=Belarus%20to%20attend%20World%20Investment%20Forum%20in%20Geneva"], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-19T10:50:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "vk ok t m\nMINSK, 19 October (BelTA) \u2013 Belarus will take part in the World Investment Forum of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Geneva on 22-26 October, BelTA learned from the National Agency of Investment and Privatization of Belarus.\nThe forum participants will discuss foreign direct investment to promote sustainable development.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-hoon More By Sumeet Chatterjee and Clare Jim\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Global banks including Citigroup (C.N) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L) have asked their private banking staff to postpone or reconsider travel to China after authorities there prevented a UBS (UBSG.S) banker from leaving the country, sources said.\nBNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and JPMorgan (JPM.N) have also asked their private banking employees to reconsider their China travel plans after the authorities' action against the UBS banker, two people familiar with the matter said.\nSwiss private bank Julius Baer (BAER.S), which manages assets worth $390 billion globally, has asked staff to be cautious about China travel plans, a separate person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nThe Singapore-based UBS banker, who is a client relationship manager in the Swiss bank's wealth management unit, still has her passport, but was last week asked to delay her departure from Beijing and remain in China to meet with local authority officials this week. Her identity was not known.\nThe purpose of the meeting with Chinese authorities is not clear. UBS has declined to comment on the matter. However, the uncertainty has led the Swiss bank, and now several of its rivals, to require their private banking staff carefully consider trips to China, the sources said.\nTheir caution highlights the risks involved for global private banks in pursuing what is arguably the biggest opportunity worldwide in the wealth management business.\nChina is the biggest growth driver of the wealth industry in Asia with its large and growing pool of millionaires and billionaires spawned by the country's booming technology sector, making it a key battleground for global private banks.\nBut its financial sector is under sharp scrutiny as Beijing attempts to lower high debt levels in the economy and curb an outflow of capital from the country to shore up the yuan, meaning there is very little room for error by industry players.\nBNP, Citi, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, and Julius Baer declined to comment. All the sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nFREQUENT TRAVEL\nUBS is unusual in having an onshore wealth management business in China as well as its offshore operations, but almost all other banks advise wealthy Chinese individuals from offshore locations mainly in Hong Kong and Singapore.\nMost offshore wealth managers travel frequently to China for informal meetings with clients, but they are not allowed to either solicit onshore business or market widely offshore investments to onshore clients.\nCiti asked staff in its Asia Pacific private banking team, via a brief email on Sunday, to postpone all China travel, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nJPMorgan has informally advised its private banking managers to review their upcoming China travel plans, three people said.\nBank of Singapore, the private banking arm of Singapore's OCBC Bank (OCBC.SI), has told staff they can continue with their ongoing China trips, but should be cautious in future travel to the mainland, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\nA Bank of Singapore spokesman declined to comment.\nUBS is the largest wealth manager operating in Asia, with $383 billion of assets under management, according to Asian Private Banker magazine, ahead of Citi, Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), HSBC (HSBA.L) and Julius Baer.\nCredit Suisse has not imposed any travel ban on its private bankers on China travel, a spokeswoman said.\nThe number of high net-worth individuals \u2013 those with at least $1 million to invest \u2013 rose by 12 percent last year in Asia Pacific, exceeding growth rates anywhere else in the world, according to consultant CapGemini.\n(Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee and Clare Jim;

has announced a partnership with Dutch bank ABN AMRO and Rotterdam Port Authority to build a shipping and logistics business based on distributed ledger technology. Samsung\u2019s NexLedger to Test Compatibility with R3\u2019s Corda in Pilot Project for Shipping Industry\nThe South Korean technology giant will be responsible for linking its blockchain platform Nexledger to ABN AMRO\u2019s distributed platform Corda, built with the major consortium R3. The pilot project will aim to simplify transactions with the Rotterdam port, including confirmation of receipt and payment, and real-time sharing of documents, says the announcement .\nThe project will verify the compatibility between Samsung SDS and ABN AMRO\u2019s blockchain platforms. The latter is specialized in financial transactions and was built by the R3 consortium, which includes some of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions including Barclays, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, UBS, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Banco Santander, and many more.\nSamsung SDS\u2019 distributed ledger platform Nexledger was designed for enterprises and was tested in the logistics field last year by a consortium project of marine logistics. This included the participation of 38 entities, including government, companies, and research institutes.\nKim Hyung-tae, vice president of the logistics division at Samsung SDS, sees the pilot project in partnership with ABN AMRO and the Rotterdam Port as an opportunity for the business relationship between Europe and South Korea as well as one more step for blockchain.\n\u201cWe have been very interested in the case of logistics blockchain in Korea and Europe which has led to this project. It will be an opportunity to increase the competitiveness of the logistics business and expand the blockchain business globally.\u201d\nThe pilot project will study the flow of payments, administration, and the physical transportation of containers with the goal of developing a functional and efficient platform for the shipping industry, according to Daphne de Kluis, chief executive of Commercial Banking at ABN AMRO.\n\u201cWe will be integrating all these flows in our pilot: from workflow management combined with track & trace to the digitization of paper documentation such as waybills and the financing of handled freight or services. The ultimate goal is to reach an open, independent and global platform that operates from the perspective of shippers. This will make the logistics chain more transparent and efficient, and millions of euros can be saved in the long term.\u201d\nThe three companies participating in the project plan to commercialize the blockchain solution for the freight transport industry worldwide.

The travel restrictions have only affected those bankers who help manage money for clients and haven\u2019t been imposed on the securities unit.\nIt was unclear under what circumstances the Singapore-based employee was detained and whether the person has been released. As part of Beijing\u2019s ongoing anti-corruption campaign, government clampdowns and unexplained absences have unsettled executives with operations in China, where even the president Interpol recently disappeared abruptly as a result of a bizarre detention. As reported previously, Meng Hongwei was reported missing this month after being taken into custody upon his arrival from France.\n\u201cChina\u2019s deep into an anti-corruption drive as well as effort to deleverage the economy,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201c\nChina has been a major new market for financial firms such as UBS as the share of world\u2019s wealthy has soared in the region. UBS estimates a new billionaire is minted in China every two days and Credit Suisse this week said China\u2019s total wealth has risen 1,300 percent this century to $51.9 trillion, more than double the rate of any other nation. The number of High Net Worth individuals in Asia-Pac recently surpassed that of North America, and at 6.2 million was the highest of any geographic region in the world. Asia HNW Population, 2010 - 2017 - Click to enlarge\nTaking advantage of foreign interest in its capital, China has thrown open its financial markets to foreign firms, a move that has given global companies unprecedented access to the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, even as crackdowns on foreign professionals have been on the rise.\nAs for UBS, the world\u2019s largest wealth manager has a long history in China and, according to Bloomberg, claims to have been the first Swiss-based bank to establish a presence in the Asia Pacific region in 1964. The Swiss lender is in talks to acquire a majority stake in its Chinese securities joint venture. UBS is also the largest wealth manager in Asia, with total assets under management of $383 billion at the end of last year.\nIt now remains to be seen if the detained UBS banker was actually guilty of a crime, and if not, whether the Zurich-based bank will forget all about the incident in hopes of further profit upside, or if it will demand fair treatment for its employees at the risk of angering local authorities and having its charter removed for making a big fuss. Considering that UBS has yet to officially confirm this incident ever took place \u2013 a UBS spokesman declined to comment on the ban and detention \u2013 and Bloomberg had to report about it using \u201canonymous sources\u201d, it is pretty clear which way the bank is leaning.

A culture of mansplaining, laddy sports events, and a failure to recognize female leaders has been failing the female pound (and dollar). Today, three quarters of women say financial services is the industry they\u2019re most disappointed with. This has to change: female private wealth is booming (increasing from $34 trillion to $51 trillion in the years 2010-2015, and expected to hit $72 trillion by 2020). Between the multimillion-pound properties of London\u2019s Kensington and Chelsea, is Grace, a women\u2019s-only business club where the capital\u2019s female business leaders pay \u00a35,000 ($6,500) a year or \u00a338,000 ($49,000) for lifetime membership. Secretly, the most powerful female figureheads of global finance have been holding meetups in its luxurious lounges for the past two years.\nMore than 20 senior businesswomen from finance, including the likes of JPMorgan, Barclays, Citi, Goldman Sachs, AXA and UBS, are now \u2014 for the first time \u2014 bringing this underground alliance into the open.\nWhy? Because a culture of mansplaining, laddy events and a failure to recognize female leaders isn\u2019t just failing women in finance, it\u2019s failing women everywhere, leaving three quarters of female clients disappointed, they tell Forbes . Lauren Garey, banker at JP Morgan. Photo courtesy of JP Morgan.\nFemale billionaires hold $876 billion of global wealth, women represent a market bigger than China and India\u2019s combined GDP, and their private wealth is rising, set to grow up to $72 trillion by 2020 according to the Boston Consulting Group. The world\u2019s banks are acting now because the female pound (or dollar) cannot be ignored.\n\u201cThere are open ongoing dialogues, and there are disagreements,\u201d says JPMorgan banker Lauren Garey, who started the \u201cDifference & Dividend\u201d group after six years in finance (she affectionately nicknamed this the \u201cNoah's Ark of female finance\u201d thanks to its collection of high-profile members). But Garey\u2019s aim is clear: to help women receive the services they need and to bring better gender balance across finance.\nUnlike typical banking socials, meetings at Grace are not an excuse to knock back pinot grigio, or indulge in the spa or wellness treatment the club offers. At once both friends and competitors, the collective shares best practice at least every quarter over glasses of fresh-squeezed orange juice at Grace, or sometimes it heads to JPMorgan\u2019s Mayfair office for presentations.\nGarey, aged 27\u2014one of the group\u2019s younger members\u2014calls for a \u201cgender-neutral\u201d approach to female finance, an end to female-only advisory committees, and a focus on the individual. \u201cOur female clients tell us they want to be in \u2018the club\u2019 not in \u2018the girls club,\u2019 \u201d she tells Forbes .\nEvents too are changing. \u201cShe doesn't need a bank to invite her shopping or for a glass of champagne: she can do that on her own,\u201d says Garey of JP Morgan\u2019s female clients. Instead, Garey pushes intellectual capital, with recent JPMorgan events hosted by millionaire fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, multi-millionaire telecoms Director Miranda Curtis, and Sarah Wood, founder of Unruly, the British video startup sold for \u00a3114 million in 2015. Grace Belgravia. Photo courtesy of Grace.\nDeborah Sayagh, a private banker at Investec group, is also part of the alliance. She told Forbes her female clients had called out \u201cmansplaining\u201d financial advisors in a perception study commissioned by the firm last March: the male asset managers mistakenly assuming their female clients would be financially illiterate.\nBut equal treatment doesn\u2019t always mean the same treatment. Sayagh says her female clients prefer a \u201csubtler\u201d personal sell, with more face-to-face meetings. The banker also supports the bank\u2019s shift from cricket and rugby sponsorship to \u201cneutral\u201d activities around the arts, theatre, and fine dining\u2014in February, Investec hosted a women's dinner at Core, the restaurant run by 3-time Michelin star chef Clare Smyth.\nPromoting gender diversity within the sector will also improve the experience of female clients the group agrees. Finance boasts a 50/50 gender split, but Britain\u2019s debut Gender Pay Gap reports show few women are promoted to senior positions, or into the sector\u2019s well-paid areas of investment banking and trading. JPMorgan is not alone in its reflection of this, with men earning salaries 26% higher than women, receiving bonuses that are 41% higher, and women making up just 22% of top-tier roles at the firm.\nSelina-Valencia McDonald, a banker at Barclays, and another member of the group, is one of just a handful of women working on a floor of more than 70 men. But where a scarcity of women might previously have created a \u201cqueen bee attitude\u201d amongst her peers, McDonald says women are today nurturing each other's professional growth more than ever, both within Barclays and externally. \u201cYou don't have to take on masculine character traits,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou can be a female who will succeed and I love that.\u201d Jo Andrews, cofounder Equileap. Photo courtesy of Equileap.\nGroup member Jo Andrews, cofounder of gender equality data firm Equileap, says banks not only need gender diversity to attract the best talent, but that diversity will soon govern banks\u2019 access to capital. More and more funds are being channeled towards companies that put gender diversity at their heart, Andrews explains, and since it launched in September 2017, Equileap has processed $500 million in what has been dubbed \u201c gender lens investing ,\u201d, a practice that grew by 41% last year.\nClosing the gender pay gap won\u2019t be easy. Comments like \u201cthis isn't even an issue\u201d and \u201cwhy are we discussing this\u201d remain common. But as Garey, who is sailing her Noah\u2019s Ark out into the open for the first time, says: gender diversity and equal service for female clients should be \"business as usual.\" Kitty writes about startups with a focus on promoting female founders and diversity in business.

The banks\u2019 representatives declined to comment.\nRestricting travel to the world\u2019s second largest economy shows that many banks are rattled by last week\u2019s events, even as they try to push ahead with winning business in a country that creates more billionaires by the week.

The MSCI AC World Index has fallen 4 percent in 2018 and is down more than 6 percent so far in October, on track for its biggest monthly decline since August 2015.\nStill, Winter doesn\u2019t see an end to the outperformance of fast-growing companies which are better placed to withstand any renewed volatility, he said. UBS argues that better use of technology has allowed companies in the consumer, industrial, financial and health care sectors to generate returns from lower capital bases than before, marking a break with history.\n\u201cThese companies are more profitable than any have been in the past,\u201d he said. Value stocks may see a pullback, but one that\u2019s likely to be short-lived, he added.\nNevertheless, the bank expects volatility to pick up from here. The Cboe Volatility Index has risen almost 80 percent this year and hit the highest level since February on Oct. 11.\nRising interest rates could spell a vicious cycle for some companies as their cost of capital increases and they are forced to refinance debt at higher rates, according to UBS.\nShould profits decline late in the economic cycle, firms with already low margins may be reluctant to give detailed guidance on earnings to the market, Winter said.

A UBS spokesman said on Tuesday the bank had lifted its own travel restrictions. The moves came after a UBS wealth manager\u2019s departure from China was delayed last week. Julius Baer Group Ltd. also barred trips by its relationship managers.\nRestrictions on travel to China are a tough choice for global banks, with the world\u2019s second-largest economy creating more billionaires by the week. The UBS wealth manager, who focuses on China, had delayed her departure after being asked to meet with local officials on an unknown matter, a person familiar with the issue said. UBS has been told the meeting is due to happen this week, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details aren\u2019t public.\n\u201cChina is a very big wealth market where a lot of people are trying to diversify their investments inside and outside of the country,\u201d Chen Shujin, financial analyst at Huatai Securities Co. in Hong Kong, said by phone. \u201cAt the same time, this is not an easy task given its capital controls. Foreign firms trying to tap this business are facing different obstacles.\u201d\nThe travel advice given by Citigroup and JPMorgan was earlier reported by Reuters, which said that Standard Chartered Plc had also asked its private banking employees to restrict travel to China. A spokeswoman at Standard Chartered declined to comment, as did representatives for Citigroup, JPMorgan and Julius Baer.\nNot every bank in the region imposed restrictions. A Credit Suisse Group AG spokesman said no travel ban was in place for its staff, while DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and Morgan Stanley reminded employees of their travel policies and guidelines, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThere\u2019s a vast private banking opportunity in China. The collective fortunes of China\u2019s uber-rich grew a staggering 65 percent, or $177 billion, in 2017, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world\u2019s 500 wealthiest people.\nWhat has long looked like a golden opportunity -- the second-biggest pool of ultra-rich people in the world -- comes with strict regulations, tight capital controls and competition from domestic financial brands. The Chinese government is also cracking down on riskier, higher-yielding products, which has given global banks a reason to reevaluate onshore operations.\nUBS\u2019s travel restriction only affected those who help manage money for clients and hadn\u2019t been imposed on other business units. The bank estimates a new billionaire is minted in China every two days.\nThe Swiss firm is the largest wealth manager in Asia, with assets under management of $383 billion at the end of 2017, according to Asian Private Banker, followed by Citigroup, Credit Suisse and HSBC Holdings Plc.\n--With assistance from Patrick Winters and Donal Griffin.\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Cathy Chan in Hong Kong at kchan14@bloomberg.net;Alfred Liu in Hong Kong at aliu226@bloomberg.net;Chanyaporn Chanjaroen in Singapore at cchanjaroen@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sam Mamudi at smamudi@bloomberg.net, Jeanette Rodrigues\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\u00a92018 Bloomberg L.P.", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": 5, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_7qTIB0MYii5Zb27Ym0OkQ--~B/aD0xMzM1O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/bloomberg_politics_602/923f93899d5f8b378ccc996edae9a2b2", "participants_count": 0, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-23T06:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "media", "tech"], "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site_section": "http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/SIG=11cir3dso/**http%3A//rss.news.yahoo.com/rss/democrats", "site_type": "blogs", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 1, "shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Citigroup Asks Private Bankers to Rethink China Travel", "title_full": "Citigroup Asks Private Bankers to Rethink China Travel", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJTsaSlzFMXcvte2dbHdzA7Yw6VmmzwI84FoEHZPDglEYqvHtY81ixEZ_p69BG5QFC0w8L.LYE0ARsqiZwfRzGcQ--", "uuid": "d387b9b1d681c6d42ed66426920c764ee78c2f85"}, "title": "Citigroup Asks Private Bankers to Rethink China Travel", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJTsaSlzFMXcvte2dbHdzA7Yw6VmmzwI84FoEHZPDglEYqvHtY81ixEZ_p69BG5QFC0w8L.LYE0ARsqiZwfRzGcQ--", "uuid": "d387b9b1d681c6d42ed66426920c764ee78c2f85"}, {"author": "", "crawled": "2018-10-23T07:34:43.024+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "financial industry regulatory authority inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs financial services inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "greg iacurci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmen quijano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luis moyett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph quijano", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": ["https://www.ubs.com/us/en.html", "https://www.finra.org/", "http://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/aao_documents/15-01833.pdf"], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-23T00:00:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "UBS loses $20 million arbitration award over Puerto Rico investments Award is largest penalty for UBS involving the Caribbean island to date Oct 22, 2018 @ 4:00 pm By Greg Iacurci\nUBS Financial Services Inc. has lost a roughly $20 million arbitration award involving Puerto Rico bonds and closed-end funds, the largest penalty that the wirehouse brokerage has had to pay to date in such cases.\nA Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc. dispute resolution panel granted investors approximately $19.8 million related to the purchase of municipal closed-end funds and Puerto Rico bonds, as well as the use of lines of credit as investment strategies in the investors' accounts.

UBS has now lifted the curbs, spokesman Rob Stewart said in an email on Tuesday.\nA decision to restrict travel to China would be a tough choice for global banks as the world\u2019s second-largest economy creates more billionaires by the week. The UBS wealth manager, who focuses on China, had delayed her departure after being asked to meet with local officials on an unknown matter, a person familiar with the issue said. UBS has been told the meeting is due to happen this week, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details aren\u2019t public.\nCitigroup\u2019s curbs were earlier reported by Reuters, which said that Standard Chartered Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have also asked their private banking employees to restrict travel to China. Spokeswomen at Standard Chartered and JPMorgan declined to comment. Representatives for Citigroup and Julius Baer also declined to comment.\nThere\u2019s a vast private banking opportunity in China. The collective fortunes of China\u2019s uber-rich grew a staggering 65 percent, or $177 billion, in 2017, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world\u2019s 500 wealthiest people.\nHowever, what has long looked like a slam-dunk opportunity\u2014the second-biggest pool of ultrarich people in the world\u2014also comes with cumbersome regulations and strong competition from homemade financial brands. The Chinese government is also cracking down on riskier, high-yield products, which has given global banks a reason to reevaluate onshore operations.\nThe UBS travel restriction only affected those who help manage money for clients and hadn\u2019t been imposed on other UBS business units. The bank estimates a new billionaire is minted in China every two days.\n\u201cUBS would like to confirm that we allow all our staff to travel freely in and out of the country and it is business as usual for us in China,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cUBS has had a strong franchise in China for 30 years and remains fully committed to further developing our business on the mainland.\u201d\nUBS is the largest wealth manager in Asia, with total assets under management of $383 billion at the end of 2017, according to Asian Private Banker.

However, the uncertainty has led the Swiss bank, and now several of its rivals, to require their private banking staff carefully consider trips to China, the sources said.\nTheir caution highlights the risks involved for global private banks in pursuing what is arguably the biggest opportunity worldwide in the wealth management business.\nChina is the biggest growth driver of the wealth industry in Asia with its large and growing pool of millionaires and billionaires spawned by the country's booming technology sector, making it a key battleground for global private banks.\nBut its financial sector is under sharp scrutiny as Beijing attempts to lower high debt levels in the economy and curb an outflow of capital from the country to shore up the yuan, meaning there is very little room for error by industry players.\nBNP, Citi, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, and Julius Baer declined to comment. All the sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nFREQUENT TRAVEL\nUBS is unusual in having an onshore wealth management business in China as well as its offshore operations, but almost all other banks advise wealthy Chinese individuals from offshore locations mainly in Hong Kong and Singapore.\nMost offshore wealth managers travel frequently to China for informal meetings with clients, but they are not allowed to either solicit onshore business or market widely offshore investments to onshore clients.\nCiti asked staff in its Asia Pacific private banking team, via a brief email on Sunday, to postpone all China travel, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nJPMorgan has informally advised its private banking managers to review their upcoming China travel plans, three people said.\nBank of Singapore, the private banking arm of Singapore's OCBC Bank, has told staff they can continue with their ongoing China trips, but should be cautious in future travel to the mainland, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\nA Bank of Singapore spokesman declined to comment.\nUBS is the largest wealth manager operating in Asia, with $383 billion of assets under management, according to Asian Private Banker magazine, ahead of Citi, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Julius Baer.\nCredit Suisse has not imposed any travel ban on its private bankers on China travel, a spokeswoman said.\nThe number of high net-worth individuals \u2013 those with at least $1 million to invest \u2013 rose by 12 percent last year in Asia Pacific, exceeding growth rates anywhere else in the world, according to consultant CapGemini.\n(Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee and Clare Jim;

It employs about 1,800 advisors currently in 175 branches in 40 states, according to its website.\nThe firm this week also lured a 39-year brokerage veteran named Gordon Nearing, who joined its Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, branch on October 18 from Merrill Lynch, along with junior advisor Pamela Dallas and two client associates.\nNearing\u2019s teamed had been overseeing about $232 million of customer assets at Merrill\u2019s Stuart, Fla., branch, where the advisor had worked since 2009, according to the RBC spokeswoman and to Nearing\u2019s BrokerCheck record. His peripatetic career, which began at E.F. Hutton in 1979 and continued at successor firm Shearson Lehman, also included six years with Prudential Securities, five with Legg Mason Wood Walker and nine with Wachovia Securities, according to BrokerCheck.\nNearing declined to comment on his reason for leaving Merrill and for choosing RBC Wealth, aside from saying that his new home offers a strong platform for his clients. Spokespeople at Merrill Lynch declined to comment on Nearing\u2019s departure.\nRBC\u2019s U.S. wealth unit recently reinstated a 401(k) plan for brokers and also is following the route of larger rivals like Merrill Lynch of incentivizing brokers to focus on relatively affluent customers. Its fiscal 2019 compensation plan cuts payouts on small household accounts of $100,000 and less and offers brokers cash bonuses for referring such accounts to new call centers it has developed.

Nice work UBS. While we have been talking about rising rates and how the safest investments actually now have a real yield, UBS may be remembered for many years as the firm that came up with TIARA. If only I were more creative and less of a geek.\nSo where are we? Earnings, falling stock prices and rising interest rates. Earnings beats are continuing, but sales are coming up lighter than in the past. More important to investors is that the reception to good numbers is not good, and the reception to bad numbers is very bad. Companies are definitely taking a conservative road to guidance given the many uncertainties in front of them. Stock prices are lower because of the early corporate returns, plus higher interest rate fears, plus growing global macro worries.\nOn the global macro front, the outlook for Saudi Arabia gets worse by the day. World governments are circling the confused country while journalists dig into every lead and story on their desk. Will global investments made by the Kingdom and into the country be unwound? What is the discount bid for a $10b piece of Uber? As we watch the search for Khashoggi, other global puzzle pieces remain flipped with few signs of resolution: Italy, China and the U.K. And the U.S. election is only two weeks away.

(A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point.) But the shorter-dated note has the added appeal of being less sensitive to changes in interest rates, or duration risk. Meanwhile, the average S&P 500 stock yields about 1.9%.\nUltra-short-term bond funds are \u201ccurrently offering more yield than they have since before the financial crisis, and given how flat the yield curve is, investors aren\u2019t getting paid much more to invest further out the maturity spectrum,\u201d says Miriam Sjoblom, a director of fixed-income manager research at Morningstar.\n( Barron\u2019s )\nDJ Goldman\u2019s Fed rate hike outlook is more aggressive than yours\u2026\nLove that Alan Greenspan just says whatever he wants in his Barron\u2019s interview\u2026\nThere\u2019s a lot of concern about the unwinding of quantitative easing, especially as emerging markets struggle with weakening currencies.

That move by the Chinese authorities led to UBS asking its wealth management staff to reconsider any travel plans to China, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Saturday. \"UBS would like to confirm that we allow all our staff to travel freely in and out of the country and it is business as usual for us in China,\" the bank said in a statement issued to Reuters on Tuesday. \"UBS has had a strong franchise in China for 30 years and remains fully committed to further developing our business on the mainland.\" The Singapore-based UBS banker, who is a client relationship manager in the wealth management unit, was last week asked to delay departure from Beijing and remain in China to meet with local authority officials this week. Her identity was not known. While the purpose of the banker's meeting with authorities is not clear and UBS has declined to comment on the matter, the uncertainty led several of its rivals to ask private banking staff to reconsider trips to China. Their caution highlighted the risks involved for global private banks in pursuing what is arguably the biggest opportunity worldwide in the wealth management business. China is the biggest growth driver of the wealth industry in Asia with its large and growing pool of millionaires and billionaires spawned by the country's booming technology sector, making it a key battleground for global private banks. But its financial sector is under sharp scrutiny as Beijing attempts to lower high debt levels in the economy and curb an outflow of capital from the country to shore up the yuan, meaning there is very little room for error by industry players.

Her identity was not known.

PHOTO: AFP Published http://str.sg/ohQL Copy\nBEIJING (BLOOMBERG) - Citigroup Inc and some other international firms are asking their wealth managers to reconsider travel to China, as UBS Group AG removed similar curbs.\nThe moves come after a UBS wealth manager's departure from China was delayed last week, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nUBS and Julius Baer Group Ltd had imposed restrictions on staff travel after the incident, other people familiar with the matter had said last Friday (Oct 19).\nZurich-based UBS has now lifted the curbs, spokesman Rob Stewart said in an e-mail on Tuesday.\n\"UBS would like to confirm that we allow all our staff to travel freely in and out of the country and it is business as usual for us in China,\" he said.\nA decision to restrict travel to China would be a tough choice for global banks as the world's second-largest economy creates more billionaires by the week.\nThe UBS wealth manager, who focuses on China, had delayed her departure after being asked to meet with local officials on an unknown matter, a person familiar with the issue said.\nUBS has been told the meeting is due to happen this week, said the person, who asked not to be named because the details aren't public.\nCitigroup's curbs were earlier reported by Reuters, which said that Standard Chartered Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have also asked their private banking employees to restrict travel to China.\nSpokeswomen at Standard Chartered and JPMorgan declined to comment. Representatives for Citigroup and Julius Baer also declined to comment.\nThere is a vast private banking opportunity in China. The collective fortunes of China's uber-rich grew a staggering 65 per cent, or US$177 billion (S$244 billion), in 2017, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world's 500 wealthiest people.\nHowever, what has long looked like a slam-dunk opportunity - the second-biggest pool of ultra-rich people in the world - also comes with cumbersome regulations and strong competition from homemade financial brands.\nThe Chinese government is also cracking down on riskier, high-yield products, which has given global banks a reason to reevaluate onshore operations.\nThe UBS travel restriction only affected those who help manage money for clients and hadn't been imposed on other UBS business units. The bank estimates a new billionaire is minted in China every two days.\n\"UBS has had a strong franchise in China for 30 years and remains fully committed to further developing our business on the mainland,\" Stewart said.\nUBS is the largest wealth manager in Asia, with total assets under management of US$383 billion at the end of 2017, according to Asian Private Banker. It's followed by Citigroup, Credit Suisse Group AG and HSBC Holdings Plc.

A subsidiary of State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) COFCO Corporation, and China Guodian Capital Holdings Ltd. sold 14% and 12.01% of UBS Securities, respectively, for RMB 462 million and RMB 396 million.\nPreviously, UBS Securities only had 5 shareholders. The largest shareholder, Beijing Guoxiang Asset Management Co., Ltd. holding 33%; the second largest, UBS holding 24.99%; the third, Guangdong Provincial Communications Group Co., Ltd. holding 14.01%; COFCO and Guodian Capital each holding 14%.\nAs a result, there has been speculation in the media that UBS, which is expected to take a 51% stake, could be the first foreign-owned brokerage in China. Recently, China Business News confirmed the matter from Samson Lo, who said it could happen within the year.\nAccording to the report, UBS securities is the first full-licensed securities company directly invested by foreign investors in China's securities market, with revenue of RMB 862 million in 2017, net profit of RMB 428.3 million. And in the first half of 2018, this company reached the revenue of RMB 471 million, with a slight loss of RMB 2.21 million, and total assets of RMB 5.04 billion.\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 www.chinaknowledge.com Send feedback or comments to: For more news, financial weekly reports, business guides to China and other premium information, subscribe to China Knowledge today: www.chinaknowledge.com To access our page on Bloomberg, type CKFI Related News ", "thread": {"country": "CA", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": "https://img.chinaknowledge.com/newsletter/20181022/ubs.jpg", "participants_count": 0, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "", "site": "chinaknowledge.com", "site_categories": [], "site_full": "www.chinaknowledge.com", "site_section": "", "site_type": "news", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "UBS Securities en route to become China's first foreign-controlled brokerage - ChinaKnowledge", "title_full": "UBS Securities en route to become China's first foreign-controlled brokerage - ChinaKnowledge", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL8gBj.sIvptvmPYSS6v_M.nfxtHhXFlfOUr8_PSCNFQ_zHTOiee6pxfkqL8PDFZLQa0GbNvi.hWPiv1b0VLkgESaPC2mbXWPvLTYufpCKbzxo1fz5fh1A", "uuid": "c6dc91721aa9b09285cbf12855aa5cfe3d0fe026"}, "title": "UBS Securities en route to become China's first foreign-controlled brokerage - ChinaKnowledge", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTL8gBj.sIvptvmPYSS6v_M.nfxtHhXFlfOUr8_PSCNFQ_zHTOiee6pxfkqL8PDFZLQa0GbNvi.hWPiv1b0VLkgESaPC2mbXWPvLTYufpCKbzxo1fz5fh1A", "uuid": "c6dc91721aa9b09285cbf12855aa5cfe3d0fe026"}, {"author": "CovFeFe", "crawled": "2018-10-23T11:14:28.022+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "overseas money transfer industry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cr\u00e9dit agricole", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unibanco holding sa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national bank of abu dhabi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indusind bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal bank of canada", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "santander", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": ["https://t.me/cryptomediapress", "https://coinpedia.org/currency/", "https://coinpedia.org/news/national-bank-abu-dhabi-partners-ripple-cross-border-payment-solutions/", "https://coinpedia.org/news/swift-ripple-cross-border-payments-blockchain/", "https://coinpedia.org/subscribe/", "https://coinpedia.org/blockchain-partners/"], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-23T10:39:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "Telegram\nIt\u2019s not just overseas money transfer companies that are turning to the blockchain. Since 2017, a number of major banks in Europe, along with IBM, have entered into a partnership that relies on Digital Trade Chain (DTC), a new blockchain-based trade finance platform. Santander became the first bank in the United Kingdom to carry out live international money transfers through its app using blockchain technology.\nSome of the other banks that have turned to Ripple include UBS, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Itau Unibanco Holding SA, IndusInd Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, and the National Bank of Abu Dhabi . These banks view Ripple\u2019s exchange network and payment protocol as an effective way to carry out cross-border fund transfers. Will Transfer Costs Reduce?\nAccording to the World Bank, the average cost of carrying out an international money transfer is a little over 7%. Data also suggests that while the average cost of using a bank is around 11%, it drops to around 5.3% with online money transfer specialists. Incidentally, overseas money transfer companies still rely on banks to act as intermediaries.\nCompanies that rely on blockchain to carry out overseas money transfers have the potential to eliminate banks from the transfer process completely. The reduced costs then should have a trickledown effect on customers. Reduced Vulnerability\nIn 2017, hackers targeted a Russian bank and successfully made away with around U.S. 6 million (RUB 339.5 million). They made use of SWIFT, a global payment network . This attack was made possible was because the banking sector continues to operate in a centralized manner, making it vulnerable to different kinds of online threats.\nBlockchain operates in a completely decentralized manner, making it rather impervious to online attacks. Each blockchain-based transaction is marked with unique entry and timestamp in a digital ledger. This data is impossible to falsify. Reaching Out to a Wider Demographic\nWhile people living in several regions in Asia, South America, and Africa remain underbanked, mobile phone usage among them has increased significantly. People who have been dependant on companies with agent networks. To receive funds from overseas can now make use of cryptocurrency -based mobile wallets. Are There Downsides?\nMaking use of blockchain technology in the world of overseas money transfers presents a few risks as of now.\nWith no legal precedents in place and with regulations still being formed, there is an element of risk surrounding legalities. In addition, the absence of a central regulatory body may expose users to new risks.\nLosing an account\u2019s private key may result in complete loss of data and funds. Individuals may access private keys of other users in public blockchain-based systems. Exposure to currency conversion twice\nUntil the use of cryptocurrencies becomes mainstream, the problem of exposure to currency conversion twice may well remain in place. This is because the sender first needs to buy a cryptocurrency using a fiat currency. Then the recipient needs to sell the cryptocurrency to purchase a fiat currency. Conclusion\nBlockchain holds the potential of changing the way people carry out international money transfers. However, how quickly the technology becomes mainstream may well depend on people\u2019s acceptance of cryptocurrencies into their everyday lives.\nYou can subscribe to our newsletter for more latest updates and have a look at our blockchain partners here.\nImage Credits- thesanguy, bijouconcierge, incrypts, yourstory.", "thread": {"country": "US", "domain_rank": null, "main_image": "https://beat.10ztalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/ATT-will-launch-another-streaming-service-in-2019-with-HBO-and-other-WarnerMedia-content-VentureCanvas.gif", "participants_count": 1, "performance_score": 0, "published": "2018-10-23T10:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Tech Talk", "site": "venturecanvas.com", "site_categories": ["media"], "site_full": "www.venturecanvas.com", "site_section": "https://beat.10ztalk.com/feed", "site_type": "blogs", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "What is Blockchain Doing for the Overseas Money Transfer Industry? | #VentureCanvas", "title_full": "What is Blockchain Doing for the Overseas Money Transfer Industry? | #VentureCanvas", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFDg2uGxlElAVrzdPPFrYG2f9dl8wvKdQfxJcxCrvqTmZtqX4v5qhuNcu4ywxKR2WHPYPu1pOrpOdKSKb0fhrrvC9ZszvTQHSgN6jaID.VLGvHVrjscrTNd8DYV42FZkJ52OOyvL9N3ZWMIvm_dEhCLr4mv2SboN8-", "uuid": "258dd7932f576436a05b18a094104047dba3e8ed"}, "title": "What is Blockchain Doing for the Overseas Money Transfer Industry? | #VentureCanvas", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSFDg2uGxlElAVrzdPPFrYG2f9dl8wvKdQfxJcxCrvqTmZtqX4v5qhuNcu4ywxKR2WHPYPu1pOrpOdKSKb0fhrrvC9ZszvTQHSgN6jaID.VLGvHVrjscrTNd8DYV42FZkJ52OOyvL9N3ZWMIvm_dEhCLr4mv2SboN8-", "uuid": "258dd7932f576436a05b18a094104047dba3e8ed"}, {"author": "Fake News Desk", "crawled": "2018-10-23T11:23:34.003+03:00", "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "citigroup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ubs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julius baer group ltd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "curb china travel", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "rob stewart", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "external_links": ["https://www.amazon.com/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=fakenewsmatte-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=c8f7ceba865dcae4cfd2e746cb7291c5&camp=1789&creative=9325"], "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "ord_in_thread": 0, "published": "2018-10-23T10:58:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "text": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were among international firms that asked their wealth managers to reconsider travel to China, according to people familiar with the matter, as UBS Group AG removed its curbs.

The Swiss asset manager's problems are seeping beyond the funds managed by that employee.\nGAM had net outflows of 8.5 billion Swiss francs ($8.5 billion) from its investment management business in the third quarter, the company said in a statement Tuesday. Most of those outflows were caused by clients fleeing the fund manager after its reputation was battered by the mishandling of the suspension of fund manager Tim Haywood .\nGAM's CEO, former UBS investment chief Alex Friedman , has been struggling to mend the company's reputation since the surprise suspension of a star fund manager in July. Haywood's funds were closed down after a whistle blower highlighted his investments in unlisted securities issued by GFG Alliance, a company controlled by British-Indian billionaire Sanjeev Gupta , as finews.asia reported last month.\nChallenging Conditions\nThe outflows, which do not include funds that have been liquidated, were caused by \u00abchallenging market conditions and for the industry and the impact from absolute return bond fund-related matters in August and September,\u00bb the company said, referring to the so-called unconstrained bond investment strategies.\nHaywood's suspension also caused the liquidation of funds containing a total of 7.7 billion francs, further depressing assets managed by GAM. Clients withdrew 5.3 billion francs from funds that were not linked to the suspension. Those withdrawals contributed to a drop to 66.8 billion francs in assets under management, from 84.4 billion at the end of June.\nIncluding its private labelling offering, the company managed 146.1 billion francs at the end of the third quarter, compared to 163.8 billion francs three months earlier.\nTakeover Target\nGAM has been mulling over a slew of options since its problems became public at the end of July. One possible solution could be the sale of the firm to a rival asset manager.

A paramilitary policeman watches a flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square ahead of the opening session of the National Peopl\nBy Sumeet Chatterjee and Clare Jim\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Global banks including Citigroup and Standard Chartered have asked their private banking staff to postpone or reconsider travel to China after authorities there prevented a UBS banker from leaving the country, sources said.\nBNP Paribas and JPMorgan have also asked their private banking employees to reconsider their China travel plans after the authorities' action against the UBS banker, two people familiar with the matter said.\nSwiss private bank Julius Baer, which manages assets worth $390 billion globally, has asked staff to be cautious about China travel plans, a separate person familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nThe Singapore-based UBS banker, who is a client relationship manager in the Swiss bank's wealth management unit, still has her passport, but was last week asked to delay her departure from Beijing and remain in China to meet with local authority officials this week. Her identity was not known.\nThe purpose of the meeting with Chinese authorities is not clear. UBS has declined to comment on the matter. However, the uncertainty has led the Swiss bank, and now several of its rivals, to require their private banking staff carefully consider trips to China, the sources said.\nTheir caution highlights the risks involved for global private banks in pursuing what is arguably the biggest opportunity worldwide in the wealth management business.\nChina is the biggest growth driver of the wealth industry in Asia with its large and growing pool of millionaires and billionaires spawned by the country's booming technology sector, making it a key battleground for global private banks.\nBut its financial sector is under sharp scrutiny as Beijing attempts to lower high debt levels in the economy and curb an outflow of capital from the country to shore up the yuan, meaning there is very little room for error by industry players.\nBNP, Citi, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, and Julius Baer declined to comment. All the sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.\nFREQUENT TRAVEL\nUBS is unusual in having an onshore wealth management business in China as well as its offshore operations, but almost all other banks advise wealthy Chinese individuals from offshore locations mainly in Hong Kong and Singapore.\nMost offshore wealth managers travel frequently to China for informal meetings with clients, but they are not allowed to either solicit onshore business or market widely offshore investments to onshore clients.\nCiti asked staff in its Asia Pacific private banking team, via a brief email on Sunday, to postpone all China travel, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nJPMorgan has informally advised its private banking managers to review their upcoming China travel plans, three people said.\nBank of Singapore, the private banking arm of Singapore's OCBC Bank, has told staff they can continue with their ongoing China trips, but should be cautious in future travel to the mainland, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\nA Bank of Singapore spokesman declined to comment.\nUBS is the largest wealth manager operating in Asia, with $383 billion of assets under management, according to Asian Private Banker magazine, ahead of Citi, Credit Suisse, HSBC and Julius Baer.\nCredit Suisse has not imposed any travel ban on its private bankers on China travel, a spokeswoman said.\nThe number of high net-worth individuals \u2013 those with at least $1 million to invest \u2013 rose by 12 percent last year in Asia Pacific, exceeding growth rates anywhere else in the world, according to consultant CapGemini.\n(Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee and Clare Jim;
